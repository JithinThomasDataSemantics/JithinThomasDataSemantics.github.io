        "eng": "<p>La Couronne, or \"the Crown,\" is a town in France located to the south-west of Angouleme. The Abbey of Our Lady of La Couronne is nothing more now than a pile of ruins that remain from what was once a Benedictine monastery. The first high abbey dates from the 12th century, when on May 12, 1118, Lambert and his religious brothers laid the cornerstone of the Church of the Crown.</p><p>On March 12th, on Passion Sunday in the year 1122, the religious make their entry into the primitive church of the Crown in the presence of Bishop William of Perigueux and Bishop Gerard of Angouleme, as well as the Papal Legate Wulgrin II, the count of Angouleme. Lambert was elected to be the first abbot, and was consecrated on Easter Sunday.</p><p>The first Abbey Church was replaced by a second, and larger, church, which was necessitated by the spiritual renewal that took place at the end of the 12th century due to the Gregorian reform. It was consecrated in the year 1201 while Junius was abbot.</p><p>The abbey suffered heavy damage during the Hundred Years War, although the two western bays of the nave and the fa\u00e7ade were subsequently rebuilt in the Gothic style. The church was then again damaged during the French wars of religion. Seized as a national asset during the French Revolution, the grounds were used as a quarry until it the property became an historical Monument in 1903. Even so, the plundering of some of the buildings continued for nearly another century until all of the ruins became protected in the year 1999.</p><p>There are now tours where families spend a few moments casually strolling through the empty and lifeless ruins where once hundreds of prayerful monks spent their entire lives in solitude and service to God.</p>"

    "Apparition to Blessed Angela de Foligno": {
        "eng": "<p>Blessed Angela of Foligno was born in 1248 of a prominent family in Foligno, three leagues from Assisi. As a young woman, and also as a wife and mother, she lived only for the world and its vain pleasures. But the grace of God intended to make of her a vessel of election for the comfort and salvation of many. A ray of the divine mercy touched her soul and so strongly affected her as to bring about a conversion.</p><p>At the command of her confessor, Blessed Angela of Foligno committed to writing the manner of her conversion in eighteen spiritual steps.</p><p>\"Enlightened by grace,\" Blessed Angela of Foligno wrote in this account. \"I realized my sinfulness; I was seized with a great fear of being damned, and I shed a flood of tears. I went to confession to be relieved of my sins, but through shame I concealed the most grievous ones, but still I went to Communion. Now my conscience tortured me day and night. I called upon St. Francis for help, and, moved by an inner impulse, I went into a church where a Franciscan Father was then preaching. It is reported that in the year 1285 she had a vision of both the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Francis of Assisi, who called her to penance.</p><p>\"I gathered courage to confess all my sins to him, and I did this immediately after the sermon. With zeal and perseverance I performed the penance he imposed, but my heart continued to be full of bitterness and shame. I recognized that the divine mercy has saved me from hell, hence I resolved to do rigorous penance; nothing seemed too difficult for me, because I felt I belonged in hell. I called upon the saints, and especially upon the Blessed Virgin, to intercede with God for me.</p><p>Mary appears to Angela of Foligno, cont:</p><p>\"It appeared to me now as if they had compassion on me, and I felt the fire of divine love enkindled within me so that I could pray as I never prayed before. I had also received a special grace to contemplate the cross in which Christ had suffered so much for my sins. Sorrow, love, and the desire to sacrifice everything for Him filled my soul.\"</p><p>About this time God harkened to the earnest desire of the penitent: her mother died, then her husband, and soon afterwards all her children. These tragic events were very painful to her; but she made the sacrifice with resignation to the will of God. Being freed from these ties, she dispossessed herself of all her temporal goods with the consent of her confessor, a Franciscan friar named Arnoldo, so that being poor herself, she might walk in the footsteps of her poor Savior. It was to Arnoldo what she dictated her account of her conversion, now known as the 'Memoriale,' or the 'Book of Visions and Instructions.'</p><p>She also entered the Third Order of St. Francis, and presently found herself the superior and guide of others who followed in her path. Many women joined her, even to the point of taking the three vows. She encouraged them in works of charity, in nursing the sick, and in going personally from door to door to beg for the needs of the poor.</p><p>Meanwhile, Angela became still more immersed in the contemplation of the Passion of Christ, and she chose the Sorrowful Mother and the faithful disciple John as her patrons. The sight of the wounds which her Lord suffered for her sins urged her to the practice of still greater austerities. Once Our Lord showed her that His Heart is a safe refuge in all the storms of life. She was soon to be in need of such a refuge. God permitted her to be afflicted with severe temptations. The most horrible and loathsome representations distressed her soul.</p><p>The fire of concupiscence raged so furiously that she said:</p><p>\"I would rather have beheld myself surrounded with flames and permitted myself to be continually roasted that to endure such things.\"</p><p>Still, she called out to God,</p><p>\"Glory be to Thee, O Lord! Thy cross is my resting place.\"</p><p>These painful trials lasted over two years; but then the purified and tried servant of the Lord was filled with great consolation. She obtained a marvelous insight into divine things and was very frequently found in ecstasy. For a time she had the stigmata, and for many years Holy Communion was her only food, until at last, completely purified, she entered into the eternal joy of the Supreme Good on January 4, 1310.</p><p>Pope Innocent XII approved the continual devotion paid to her at her tomb in Foligno, where many miracles were attributed to her. He beatified her in 1693.</p><p>Blessed Angela of Foligno said,</p><p>\"To know oneself and to know God, that is the perfection of man; without this knowledge, visions and the greatest gifts are of no account.\"</p>"

See my hands and feet, that it is I Myself; handle and see: for a spirit hath no flesh and bones, as you see Me have.\"</p><p>The Apostles were so excited and confused, that though they saw Him and touched the wounded hands of the Savior, they could not realize, that it was He to whom they spoke and whom they touched. The loving Master in order to assure them still more, said to them:</p><p>\"Give Me to eat, if you have aught.\"</p><p>Joyfully they offered Him some fried fish and a comb of honey. He ate part of these, and divided the rest among them, saying:</p><p>\"Do you not know, that all that has happened with Me is the same that has been written by Moses and the Prophets, in the Psalms and holy Scriptures, and that all must necessarily be fulfilled in Me as it was prophesied?\"</p><p>And at these words He opened their minds, and they knew Him, and understood the sayings of the Scriptures concerning His Passion, Death, and Resurrection on the third day. Having thus instructed them, He said again:</p><p>\"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you, in order that you may teach the world the knowledge of the truth, of God and of eternal life, preaching repentance of sins and forgiveness of them in my name.\"</p><p>Breathing upon them, He added and said:</p><p>\"Receive ye the Holy Ghost, in order that the sins which you forgive may be forgiven, and those which you do not forgive, may not be forgiven. Preach ye to all nations beginning in Jerusalem.\"</p><p>Then the Savior, having thus consoled and confirmed them in faith, and having given them and all priests the power to forgive sins, disappeared from their midst.\"</p>"

According to tradition, he actually saw the Blessed Virgin Mary while he was praying by himself in church. On that day he was interrupted from his prayers when he heard angelic voices singing in heavenly harmonies. He lifted his head to see a multitude of angels entering the church, their light filling the entire place. With them were many of the saints, who processed along behind the angels. They were followed by the Queen of Heaven, who was seated upon a magnificent throne that was held aloft by the seraphim.</p><p>When the heavenly procession stopped before the main altar, Saint Bonitus hear some of the saints ask who was to say Mass. The Blessed Virgin herself turn to Saint Bonitus and said:</p><p>\"Here is Bonitus, my faithful servant and excellent bishop. He is worthy of fulfilling this holy function.\"</p><p>Some of the blessed saints then detached themselves from the others and approached the holy bishop, who was startled and trembling as they raised him to his feet. Taking him by the hand, they accompanied the bishop to the choir where they clothed him in a chasuble of marvelous workmanship that the Blessed Virgin had brought for him to say this Mass. The saints and angels assisted the bishop as acolytes.</p><p>When the Mass was ended the Blessed Virgin, the saints and angels left the bishop alone again. Two years later Saint Bonitus retired and went to the abbey of Manlieu, where he remained until he died in the year 710. The chasuble that was the gift of the Blessed Virgin was kept at Clermont until the year 1793, when it was burned with many other sacred relics by the broad minded insurrectionists of the French Revolution.</p>"

        "eng": "<p>Saint Herman (1150?-1241) was a member of the Premonstratensian Order and a mystic. Born in Cologne, he was the son of Count Lothair of Meer, and his mother was Saint Hildegund. He was well educated, and it was known that from his earliest youth he spent all of his free time praying to the Blessed Virgin at the local church of Saint Mary. Once, while still a young boy, he innocently offered an apple saved from his own lunch to a statue of Our Lord, and was not surprised when a hand was extended and the apple was accepted.</p><p>One bitterly cold winter's day, as little Saint Herman was walking barefoot into church, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to him to inquire why he was going about barefoot in such freezing weather.</p><p>\"Alas! Dear Lady,\" Saint Herman answered, \"it is because my parents are so poor.\"</p><p>The Blessed Virgin pointed to a stone nearby, instructing little Herman to look under it. He promptly obeyed, and found four pieces of silver, just what he would need to purchase new shoes.</p><p>Returning to give thanks to his Blessed Mother, in another apparition to Saint Herman, she directed him to return to the same spot with faith and confidence that his needs would be met, and then departed. Never did he want for any necessity, though his friends, animated by a different spirit, would never find anything when they looked beneath the stone.</p><p>On another occasion Saint Herman saw the Blessed Virgin high up in the tribune, conversing with the Child Jesus and St. John. He longed to join them, but sadly realized there was no way for him to do so. Suddenly, Herman found himself at their side and began conversing with the Infant Jesus.</p><p>At age twelve Saint Herman went to the Norbertine, or Premonstratensian, house at Steinfeld, and was sent to continue his studies in the Netherlands because of his youth. Once he had completed his studies, he returned and was allowed to join the order and was made sacristan and also served in the refectory.</p><p>Because of his purity, Herman's fellow-novices soon began calling him Joseph, in honor of Our Lord's foster father. When he objected to such high praise, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to him and took him as her spouse, confirming that it was her desire that he should accept the name.</p><p>Pope Pius XII formally recognized that Joseph Herman was a saint in the year 1958.</p>"

    "Appearance of Our Lady to St Agnes": {
        "eng": "<p>Saint Agnes of Montepulciano was born into a noble family in the village of Gracciano, Italy, in about the year 1268. A miracle occurred to demonstrate that she was a predestined soul, for it is recalled that burning torches appeared to illuminate her crib on the day she was born. Agnes was no more than four years old when she began seeking solitude where she could pray privately for many hours to Jesus, whom she already loved.</p><p>At the age of nine Saint Agnes told her parents that she desired to enter the Dominican monastery at nearby Montepulciano. Both parents initially opposed Agnes' wish, so she prayed that God might change their opinions. In a short time she entered the convent and began living under the rule of Saint Augustine. The sisters she lived with soon recognized that Agnes appeared more like an angelic spirit than a human being. She lived an austere life, sleeping on the ground with a stone for a pillow, and fasted on bread and water.</p><p>To test Agnes' holiness and commitment to her prayer life, the sisters gave her difficult duties to perform in the convent. They were greatly edified to see that Agnes regularly completed her duties without complaint, and that she continued with her prayer life and regular acts of charity. In fact, it was about this time that Agnes could be observed absorbed in prayer while seemingly unaware that she was suspended nearly two feet above the ground, or violets, lilies or roses would be found growing up through the stones where Saint Agnes had just prayed.</p><p>Several of the residents of the town of Procena built a monastery for their daughters, and naturally desired that Saint Agnes should come with some of her sisters and become the prioress of the new convent. Agnes was only 15 years old, and feared for her humility should she accept the position. Pope Nicholas IV commanded her to accept the office, so she agreed to become the superior of the sisters there.</p><p>There are many miracles recorded at this time involving St Agnes of Montepulciano. She frequently multiplied loaves, as Christ did in the gospels, to feed those in need. She had also apparently reached such a level of sanctity that invalids and those afflicted with different types of mental illness would be restored to health just by being brought into her presence.</p><p>The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Saint Agnes and told her that she would one day found a large monastery based on faith in the Most High and undivided Trinity. She did in fact establish the convent under the Dominican rule, as she had been instructed by an angel, about the year 1300, as the citizens of Montepulciano had built a new convent there, hoping to lure Agnes back to them. She governed there until her death in 1317.</p><p>Agnes was known to have experienced several visions during her life. On the night of the Feast of the Assumption, the Blessed Virgin placed the Infant Jesus in her arms. She encouraged Agnes to continue suffering for the love of Christ - she had been sick practically all her life. The Mother of God left with St Agnes of Montepulciano a small cross to comfort and strengthen her. This little cross is still shown with great solemnity to pilgrims, especially during the month of May. Mary likewise vouchsafed Agnes a vision of Christ's suffering, which lasted three days.</p><p>To comfort Agnes, Mary appeared to her on the feast of the Purification while she was at Holy Mass. Mary told her this was the hour she had taken the Child Jesus to offer Him in the Temple. Our Lady smiled sweetly, and gave Agnes her Babe to hold and caress. Saint Agnes was also known to have received Holy Communion from an angel. She experienced repeated levitations, as noted above, and performed miracles for the faithful of the region.</p><p>Shortly before her death, Saint Agnes was sent to bathe in springs that were thought to have curative powers. The waters did nothing to help Agnes, though a new spring emerged close by which did indeed have curative power. It was given the name \"the Water of Saint Agnes.\" While there, the saint prayed over a child who had recently drowned, bringing the child back to life.</p><p>St Agnes of Montepulciano then went back to the monastery, where she died on April 20th, 1317, at the age of only 43. Her body was found to be incorrupt, and a mysterious, sweet smelling liquid was observed to stream from both her hands and feet. When Saint Catherine of Siena went to pray before Saint Agnes' incorrupt body, the deceased saint lifted her foot for Saint Catherine to kiss. She also revealed to Saint Catherine that they would both enjoy the same amount of glory in heaven.</p><p>St Agnes of Montepulciano was solemnly canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. Her feast day is April 20th.</p>"

He chose to do so in a very special way. The Catechism of the Catholic Church says, \"The prayer of the people of God flourished in the shadow of the dwelling place of God's presence on earth, the ark of the covenant and the temple, under the guidance of their shepherds, especially King David, and of the prophets\" (CCC 2594). God instructed Moses to build a tabernacle surrounded by heavy curtains (cf. Ex 25-27). Within the tabernacle he was to place an ark made of acacia wood covered with gold inside and out. Within the Ark of the Covenant was placed a golden jar holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant (cf. Heb 9:4).</p><p>When the ark was completed, the glory cloud of the Lord (the Shekinah Glory) covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (Ex 40:34-35; Nm 9:18, 22). The verb for \"to cover\" or \"to overshadow\" and the metaphor of a cloud are used in the Bible to represent the presence and glory of God.</p><p>It's easy to miss the parallel between the Holy Spirit overshadowing the ark and the Holy Spirit overshadowing Mary, between the Ark of the Old Covenant as the dwelling place of God and Mary as the new dwelling place of God.</p><p>God was very specific about every exact detail of the ark (Ex 25-30). It was a place where God himself would dwell (Ex 25:8). God wanted his words - inscribed on stone - housed in a perfect container covered with pure gold within and without. How much more would he want his Word - Jesus - to have a perfect dwelling place!

There was tense expectancy, such as one finds along a line of march as a parade approaches. A roadway of clouds billowed the pathway from an uncorrupted grave to an incorruptible throne.</p><p>At last, borne by angels, the lovely Lady arrives. It is the first Assumpton Day, the Assumption of Mary. The heavenly throng gasps with admiration. The celestial singers burst into song. The angels hurry to and fro to catch a glimpse of her and to tell their companions of her beauty.</p><p>Jesus waits at the open entrance, throws His arms about His Mother, leads her triumphantly and happily to the very throne of the heavenly Father, who leans forward and places solemnly and smilingly upon her beauteous head the crown, as the Holy Spirit, heavenly Spouse of the Virgin Mother casts warmth and light upon the welcome newcomer.</p><p>The Assumption of Mary !Sweet scene of Mary's bliss! Who can measure her happiness? Who can count the throbs of joy in her heart: joy that now her lonesome life on earth without Jesus is over; joy that now she has Him, never again to lose Him; joy that now she can enjoy His company without the interruptions of earth or sense; joy that now she can help everyone on earth who is devoted to her Son; joy that all the honor and all the praise and all the glory is given to her because of her Son; joy that the very crown she is wearing as the Queen of heaven and earth, is given to her because she is the Mother of Jesus, the Son of God; joy that an eternity is just beginning during which she can wrap herself in her Child and her Redeemer, even more closely than their lives had been entwined upon earth.\"</p><p>Our Lady assumed into Heaven! Entering body and soul into the presence of the Most Blessed and Eternal Trinity! The Assumption of Mary! Her sufferings, great beyond all measure, are nothing now as she finds her reward in the greatness of the Infinite God. What eternal joy in His possession; what peace in being eternally possessed by Him - surely the richest reward for the obedient Handmaid of the Lord.</p><p>Our reward is likewise the possession of the same Triune God - our way to Him is likewise along the same royal way as tread so humbly and submissively the feet of our obedient Queen. Her last recorded words in Sacred Scripture, her counsel to the servants at the wedding feast, applies to us with equal and unfailing force: \"Do whatever He tells you!\" Our obedience to Christ is our way to joy and peace.</p><p>Mary's death was caused by love that consumed her heart; her death was not meant for punishment nor expiation, hence there was no violence nor was it painful, since she was preserved from the dominion given to death by sin. According to an opinion accepted since the Middle Ages, Mary's death resembled Christ's, because she accepted it voluntarily out of humble and loving obedience; so, she died of love in the strict sense of the word. Death came to her in the form of the weakening of the body caused by the supernatural might of Dying Love. Her natural vitality was exhausted by love-longing, by the strength of an ecstasy of love and her great love moved God to cease keeping her alive. Mary's death was a holocaust of love where the sacrifice offered long before at the foot of the Cross in poignant and spiritual anguish was at last completed.</p><p>This feast, the Assumption of Mary, was instituted, according to Saint Bernard, in the very time of the apostles.</p>"

        "eng": "<p>The vast and magnificent basilica of Our Lady in Turin, Italy, built by Saint John Bosco between 1863 and 1868, was inspired by a dream-vision which he had in October 1844. The Blessed Virgin showed Don Bosco a vast and lofty church and said:</p><p>\"This is my house; from it my glory shines forth. You will understand everything when, with your material eyes, you will see in actual fact what you now see with the eyes of your mind.\"</p><p>Nineteen years later, Don Bosco finally set to work on the basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians. Our Lady, in a second vision, chose the location as that of the place of the martyrdom of Saint Adventer Solutor and Saint Octavious, who were both soldiers under the Emperor Maximianus in the fourth century.</p><p>When the foundation of the church was laid, Don Bosco went to the contractor, Charles Buzzetti, and told him:</p><p>\"I want to pay you at once for this fine work. I don't know if it will be much, but this is all I have.\"</p><p>He then took out his little purse and emptied the contents into the hand of the contractor, who was expecting a handful of gold coins. His jaw dropped in dismay when he saw in his hand only eight pennies.</p><p>\"Don't be alarmed,\" Don Bosco quickly added with a smile, \"the Madonna will see to the payment of her church. I am just the instrument, the cashier.\" And to those standing by he concluded, \"You will see!\"</p><p>\"The whole church was put up by means of graces granted by Mary,\" Don Bosco often said. One sixth of the cost, about one million lire in those days, was borne by the generous contributors, devout persons; the rest came from the small offering of those who had been aided by Mary either in health, in business, in family matters, or in some other way.</p><p>\"Every stone, every ornament, represents one of her graces,\" insisted Don Bosco. The original contractor, who received the eight cents, later testified that, \"The Church was paid for to the last cent.\"</p><p>Among the monuments of the Church, the most splendid is the painting above the main altar. Our Blessed Lady Help of Christians occupies the central position, and is surrounded by symbols: God the Father, the Holy Spirit, the Apostles and Evangelists. It measures more than 33 yards square, and is bordered with gold.</p><p>There was much opposition to the project of building a church dedicated to and in honor of Our Lady Help of Christians, but Don Bosco insisted. It appears he had a supernatural knowledge that the future of his own congregation, and that of the whole world in the not too distant future, depended on the powerful protection of Mary, Help of Christians, just as it had needed and obtained that protection at Lepanto on October 7, 1571, and at Vienna, on September 12, 1683.</p><p>Don Bosco won out, and the vast church was consecrated and dedicated on June 9, 1868. The dedication festivities lasted nine days, and on each day a Bishop preached while another took part in the religious ceremonies.</p><p>By the turn of the nineteenth century the Church of Our Lady Help of Christians in Turin had become famous, and in 1911, Pope Saint Pius X gave it the crowning glory by raising it to the rank of a Basilica - The Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians!</p>"

    "Saint Beatrice de Silva": {
        "eng": "<p>Saint Beatrice de Silva was born of Portuguese parents at Ceuta on Moroccan soil, and manifested a special attachment to our Immaculate Mother very early in life. At the court of the king of Castile she was presented and cast into prison by a jealous queen, but by the visible intervention of the Immaculate Queen of heaven, she was released and justified with great honor. Then she left the court and went to Toledo. On the journey thither St Francis and St Anthony appeared to her and announced that she would be the founder of a new order.</p><p>At Toledo Saint Beatrice de Silva repaired to a convent of Cistercian nuns and remained there for almost 40 years. She did not don the religious garb; nevertheless she was a model of religious perfection. Gradually the resolution took shape to establish a new order that would honor the Immaculate Mother of God. With 12 companions who entertained sentiments similar to hers, she withdrew to a separate house. Beatrice wrote the rule and asked Pope Innocent VIII to approve it. This occurred in the year 1489.</p><p>A few years earlier the Blessed Virgin had showed Saint Beatrice de Silva in a vision that she should wear a habit consisting of a white tunic and scapular with a light blue mantle. This was the origin of the Order of the Immaculate Conception, also known as the Conceptionist Poor Clares.</p><p>The whole life of the foundress was conformed to her religious rule. The rule itself can be summed up briefly in three short mottos: to be silent and submissive in all things that happen to us by God's ordinance or are required of us by holy obedience; to become small in the eyes of God, of the world, and of ourselves, and to prefer a life of obscurity; to love everyone with a holy love, and become all to all by prayer, sacrifice, and labor.</p><p>At the age of 65, Mother Beatrice departed from this life in 1492, a year after the founding of her order. Pope Pius XI enrolled her among the beatified. The Conceptionists were incorporated into the Franciscan Order and soon spread through Europe and America. Thanks to the efforts of the Franciscan bishop, Amandus Bahlmann of Santarem, a branch of this order, under the name of Missionaries of the Immaculate Conception, is doing remarkable work especially in the missions of Brazil. Their motherhouse is at Patterson, New Jersey.</p>"

    "Cause of Our Joy": {
        "eng": "<p>Joy is a thing we all love. We all naturally want to be happy, to have what causes us delight, to be free from what is distressing and irksome.</p><p>The Church sings to Our Lady: \"Thy Birth, O Virgin Mother of God, announced joy to the whole world.\" Why was this? Because Jesus was to come through Her. Jesus is the Joy of the whole world, of every soul that ever was or ever will be created, and this joy came through Mary.</p><p>Without Jesus, Who has redeemed us from sin and Hell, there would be no joy for us, either in this world or in the next. But more than this, Mary's consent was necessary, in order that Jesus might become our Redeemer. Our Lord would not even have come, had She not consented to be His Mother. She, as the Fathers of the Church tell us, cooperated in our Redemption by Her full and free consent to deliver Jesus to death for us. Could She not, for instance, have interceded with Pilate for the life of Her Son, and got witnesses to prove His innocence? But She knew Jesus was offered because He Himself willed it, and so She remained silent, hidden, patient, suffering all in Him and with Him, knowing fully, as none other ever will, the reasons for it all. This is the first way in which She is the \"Cause of Our Joy,\" through Her share in our Redemption. And also through Her position in the Kingdom of Her Son, all the joys that come to us through the Divine Kingdom of Grace, the Sacraments, and the Church, pass through the hands of Her Who is the Queen of the Church Militant, Triumphant, and Suffering. But never in this world shall we realize fully how Mary is truly the Cause of Our Joy. It is only when we get to Heaven that we shall see how Her prayers, Her maternal solicitude, Her powerful help, followed us in every step of our lives, how She interceded for us in our sorrows that we might receive comfort and consolation, how She presented our petitions to Her Son, and helped to get our prayers answered, how She saved us from temptations and falls. How She, the Star of the Sea, piloted us through the countless storms and shipwrecks on the sea of life. Above all, how we shall love to salute Her as the \"Cause of Our Joy,\" when at last we enter the heavenly Jerusalem, and Mary presents us to Jesus, as the fruit of Her tears, labors, and sufferings! \"My power is in Jerusalem.\"</p><p>When Our Lord said to Her on the Cross, \"Behold Thy Son,\" and to St. John, \"Behold thy Mother,\" She became the \"Cause of Our Joy\" in a new and most special way.</p><p>Let us then love to salute Our Mother by this most sweet title, and ask Her to be indeed to us throughout life the true Cause of Our Joy. Yes, let us ever seek true joy where alone it is to be found, where She is ever pointing it out to us, and guiding us to find it, in Her Son Jesus Christ, the Joy of All the Angels.</p><p>We think perhaps now that there are plenty of joys in the world without this heavenly joy, of which Mary is the Cause, but we must not mistake mere \"enjoyment\" for joy. Enjoyment may make us feel glad for a while, but it soon palls and wearies, and above all when it is made the goal and end of life. The more it is sought, the less does it satisfy. True joy is something deeper, quieter, more lasting, than this fleeting, exciting, deceptive thing which we call enjoyment or pleasure. It is that peace of soul, that contentment of heart, that deep enduring satisfaction which comes to us when we refuse God nothing, when we are faithful to our conscience, to our duty, to our principles, to the practice of our Religion, when we really make God \"the beginning of our joy.\" True joy is to be found in a quiet, simple life, such as was Mary's life with Jesus, Her Joy, on earth. Her life at Nazareth was more full of deep, true joy than any human life has ever been, when She had Jesus all to Herself for so many quiet years, and yet it was only the simple life of a Mother with Her Son, taking care of Him, and watching His growth and development. We need not rush wildly hither and thither, seizing every occasion of pleasure or excitement that presents itself, in our search for joy. It can be had in the quietest and most ordinary life, if our hearts are right.</p><p>St. Teresa says that earthly satisfactions reach no farther than, as it were, the husk or rind of the soul. It is thus we may for a time imagine that earthly enjoyments satisfy us, but they penetrate no farther than this outside surface, and that is why they can never fill or satiate the soul. Yet we may persuade ourselves that they are what we are craving for, because of the superficial satisfaction that we find in them.</p>"

    "Dedication of the Cave of Our Lady of Chartres": {
        "eng": "<p>During the Middle Ages a movement was afoot in Europe, known as the Rosary of Churches. Cities, small towns and even villages vied with one another to rear cathedrals to Mary. Many of these churches have faded into oblivious; some still stand in all their untouched glory, treasure houses of ancient masterpieces of art, sculpture, glasswork and architecture. Their erection was entirely voluntary, a labor of love. Those who had means and riches gave of them; others gave their labor.</p><p>The oldest of these is Our Lady's Cathedral at Chartres. Even before the Apostles arrived, there was a Celtic shrine at Chartres, dedicated to the Virgin who would bear a great King, \"a virgin who will give birth.\" A Church was built over this pagan shrine and in the church was enshrined the tunic which the Blessed Virgin was said to have worn while on earth, the gift of the Emperor Constantine. It was at Chartres, too, that Saint Bernard pleaded in 1148 for crusaders to rescue the Holy Land. The Cathedral was destroyed many times, but in the eleventh century the real and lasting church was built with a forest of columns and a treasury of art, jewels and glass. It remains a must on the list of every pilgrim traveling to Europe.</p><p>A medieval bishop named Fulbert chose to build his city's cathedral of Our Lady on top of the highest hill for miles around. He didn't have much luck and three times his cathedral burned down. One of his successors started to build the cathedral in 1250, when it was entirely completed in dressed stone it \"needed to fear nothing from the world's fire until Judgment Day.\"</p><p>It is the most important of the eighty cathedrals and nearly 500 cathedral-size churches the French people, with a single-mindedness unparalleled in Church history, built in that fantastically artistic century 1170 to 1270. To these peasants, priests and poets in stone, the Cathedral was the House of God, the Bible in picture and image, and a canticle of praise. The Cathedral of Chartres stands out in unequalled significance, spelling in delicately carved detail and magnificently balanced volumes what the Christian faith meant to twelve centuries of Europeans.</p><p>Chartres contains the most famous stained glass window in the world; its predominant, unique, remarkable blue has defied the skill to describe of writers everywhere. The sacred figures come alive in the glass and the whole nave of the church is suffused with sifted light. Everything seen after this is an anticlimax; just as the Mother of God to whom this \"other world\" art is dedicated, is the epitome of virginity, motherhood and womanhood, as all others of her sex pale into oblivion in the glorious light of her sanctity. This cathedral has a majesty and a magic about it that can still evoke memories of past unity and stir the imagination of an even larger vision.

The abbey was made possible by a second donation to the Cistercians by Count Savaric and his son William. At the same time, the knight of Arlier, Montailly, gave them the operation of a limestone quarry near St Martin de Laives, from whence came the stone used for construction of the abbey. Other charitable donations to this new monastery included a mill on the Grosne and a vineyard.</p><p>It was one of the largest Cistercian abbeys, and one of the first four abbeys for women, which included Pontigny, Clairvaux, and Morimond. These abbeys had a major role in the future organization of the Cistercian Order.</p><p>Like many abbeys, la Ferte suffered immensely during the major wars and upheavals in French history, but most especially during the hundred years' war, the religious wars, and the French Revolution. During the years 1165 and 1166, the abbey was at the very heart of disputes between Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, and the Counts Macon Gerard and Guillaume de Chalon.</p><p>The convent buildings were reconstructed during the 13th century, and in 1362 the whole complex was surrounded by a stout wall and moat with a single door served by a drawbridge. Even so, this defensive system could not hold back the determined Protestant troops of Admiral Coligny, who attacked and set the inoffensive abbey church and several other buildings on fire. Then, in 1574, Rev. Francis Beugre rebuilt the dormitory, abbey cloister, and other buildings. In the year 1760, Fr. Francois Chemilly added some new construction, including an addition to the front of the abbey house. The pediment that can still be seen is decorated with his coat of arms.</p><p>In the year 1791, the abbey was unlawfully seized and sold as the property of the French national government. It was purchased by a family that has owned the site since the Revolution, although today only the magnificent abbey \u2018palace' with its interiors remains, and it is nothing now more than a bed and breakfast inn. Turned to secular use, the owners advertise the now \"divine suits\" and the \"vast staircase, rooms with sculpted paneling, tapestries, paintings and XVIIth century furniture.\" The church, however, was never restored, and there is now no trace of the magnificent edifice once graced by the presence of Saint Bernard.</p>"

    "Comforter of the Afflicted": {
        "eng": "<p>The title Consoler of the Afflicted is one given to the Virgin Mary because having endured suffering she is able to console those who are afflicted. Blessed John Henry Newman explains the secret of true consolation \"those are able to comfort others who, in their own case, have been much tried, and have felt the need of consolation, and have received it.\"</p><p>Through her martyrdom, Mary has become in a special way the comfortress of the afflicted. It was by her own experience of sorrow that she was taught the sympathy which enables her to comfort her children in all their afflictions. God gave her a mighty and a sympathetic heart for this great task.</p><p>ST. PAUL says that his Lord comforted him in all his tribulations, that he also might be able to comfort them who are in distress, by the encouragement which he received from God. This is the secret of true consolation: those are able to comfort others who, in their own case, have been much tried, and have felt the need of consolation, and have received it. So of our Lord Himself it is said: \"In that He Himself hath suffered and been tempted, He is able to succour those also that are tempted.\"</p><p>And this too is why the Blessed Virgin is the comforter of the afflicted. We all know how special a mother's consolation is, and we are allowed to call Mary our Mother from the time that our Lord from the Cross established the relation of mother and son between her and St. John. And she especially can console us because she suffered more than mothers in general. Women, at least delicate women, are commonly shielded from rude experience of the highways of the world; but she, after our Lord's Ascension, was sent out into foreign lands almost as the Apostles were, a sheep among wolves. In spite of all St. John's care of her, which was as great as was St. Joseph's in her younger days, she, more than all the saints of God, was a stranger and a pilgrim upon earth, in proportion to her greater love of Him who had been on earth, and had gone away. As, when our Lord was an Infant, she had to flee across the desert to the heathen Egypt, so, when He had ascended on high, she had to go on shipboard to the heathen Ephesus, where she lived and died.</p><p>For all God's children, the way to heaven leads across the mount of Calvary -- the way of trial and suffering. In the company of our Sorrowful Mother we walk more easily, fight more courageously, and suffer more patiently, perseveringly and joyfully; for she holds up before us not only the example of the sufferings and death of her Divine Son, but also the victory, the joy and the glory which He has won through His sufferings.</p><p>How often do we grow impatient, fainthearted, despondent and in constant in suffering, without endurance, without resignation, full of complaints and murmurings! Oh! let us deeply engrave in our hearts the sorrows of Mary. May she, our Sorrowful Mother, ever be our model in suffering, in the patient endurance of trials, and in the humble acceptance of sorrows and afflictions. When the hand of God lays a heavy cross upon our shoulders, let us turn to Mary Sorrowing, and we shall obtain consolation and strength to carry the cross patiently and meritoriously.</p>"

The prefix, \"Co,\" comes from the Latin \"cum,\" which means \"with.\" The title of Coredemptrix applied to the Mother of Jesus never places Mary on a level of equality with Jesus Christ, the divine Lord of all, in the saving process of humanity's Redemption. Rather, it denotes Mary's singular and unique sharing with her Son in the saving work of Redemption for the human family. The Mother of Jesus participates in the redemptive work of her Savior Son, who alone could reconcile humanity with the Father in his glorious divinity and humanity.\"</p><p>Mary's entire existence has been one of cooperation with the Lord. So it was on Calvary. She who was preserved by God from Original Sin at the moment of her conception and heard from the mouth of Simeon that \"you yourself a sword will pierce so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed\" accepted the salvific death of her Son not with a \"hands-off\" approach but instead by embracing it. The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council (1962-1965), in its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Lumen Gentium) of November 21, 1964, painted the picture of Our Blessed Lady's collaboration with the Almighty, which included her heroic surrender to Christ's ignominious death.</p><p>\"Thus the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross, where she stood, in keeping with the divine plan, enduring with her only begotten Son the intensity of his suffering, associated herself with his sacrifice in her mother's heart, and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this victim which was born of her.\"</p><p>\"Mary uniquely participated in the sacrifice of Jesus on Calvary and in the acquisition of the graces of Redemption for humanity (theologically referred to as \"objective redemption\"). Mary offered her Son and her maternal rights in relation to her Son to the Heavenly Father in perfect obedience to God's will and in atonement for the sins of the world. Mary's offering of her own Son on Calvary, along with her own motherly compassion, rights and suffering, offered in union with her Son for the salvation of the human family, merited more graces than any other created person. As Pope Pius XII confirmed in his encyclical On the Mystical Body, Mary \"offered Him on Golgotha to the Eternal Father, together with the holocaust of her maternal rights and her motherly love, like a New Eve for all children of Adam.\"</p><p>Despite her enormous grief as she watched her Son die, Our Lady generously \"yielded\" Jesus to the purpose the Father through the Holy Spirit intended, namely the reconciliation of the human race to its Creator. Although what Mary did on Calvary was secondary and subordinate to what Christ did, it was, nevertheless, necessary because God made it so. In His unparalleled wisdom, the Lord required this all-encompassing--and real--sacrifice from Mary, who said her fiat with incredible trust in God as she had at the Annunciation.</p>"

Saint John had an icon of the Blessed Virgin before which he fervently prayed, and soon his hand is said to have been miraculously restored. To recognize the miracle, and in appreciation for the return of his right hand, Saint John had a replica of his restored hand produced in silver, which he then placed at the bottom of the icon. Those who came after him, and saw the third hand on the icon, subsequently named it \"Three-handed,\" or Tricheirousa.</p><p>The Bogorodica Trojerucica is considered the most important icon of the Serbian Orthodox Church.

Founded in the year 654 by Saint Philibert, it was once one of the magnificent Benedictine monasteries in France, and the home of some 700 monks with over twice that number of lay brothers. Sadly, it is now nothing more than a tourist attraction, and the vestiges of the surviving structures, though vacant, scarred, and exposed to the elements, are celebrated as a magnificent example of Romanesque art.</p><p>All that remains standing today are the church of Notre Dame with its impressive twin towers soaring to a height of 150 feet, the western facade, and sections of what were once the cloisters and library. The rest is but a pile of rubble, though it is proudly proclaimed the largest medieval ruin in France. Victor Hugo notably christened it \"the most beautiful ruin in France,\" but one is left to wonder how it once appeared when the Catholic faith was still vibrant and alive in France.</p><p>Located a little west of Rouen along a bend in the Lower Seine, it was vulnerable to the attacks of the Vikings in the ninth and tenth centuries. During one invasion it was set on fire and pillaged of its wealth. It was soon lovingly rebuilt, however, by the Duke of Normandy, and the Church of Jumieges was consecrated by Maurice, the Archbishop of Rouen, in the year 1067. William the Conqueror attended the dedication of the Church of Jumieges and the subsequent celebrations.</p><p>Larger and more beautiful than ever before, the abbey once again became wealthy and influential.

When the French Revolution came along the monastery was finished, and only the imposing ruins of what had once been a thriving community was left in its wake. In 1793 the whole was sold at auction and mined as a stone quarry. The chancel, with its marble altar, and the lantern tower were intentionally blown up, and the rest was subject to the deprivations of vandals.</p><p>What remained was rescued in the year 1852 by the Lepel-Cointet family.

It is notable that Hugh later became the bishop of Auxerre.</p><p>The monks valued the land, the woods and streams they were surrounded with, and built large farms around their abbey. They raised various crops, bread pigs and sheep, and made terracotta tiles and bricks. It was that strong economic base that enabled them to construct the great Romanesque style church that reached an impressive length of 120 meters that still stands intact today.</p><p>In the year 1164 the abbey received the Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of England Thomas Becket while he was an exile due to his opposition to King Henry, and in 1206 the Queen of France, Alix de Champagne, was buried in the choir of the abbey.</p><p>The wealthy abbey was looted and burned by the Huguenots in about 1529 during the Wars of Religion.

    "Destroyer of Heresy": {
        "eng": "<p>The Church has always accorded Our Lady this title as She Who Destroys All Heresies, from the very beginning since we know from the account of the fall of our first parents, that Satan would be punished anew for his having deceived them: that he would wait for Our Lady's heel to crush him and his seed: among those seeds are the lies of heresy as he is the Father of Lies. The first act of disobedience was in the fore-heaven by Lucifer and his rebel Angels. The first heretical act was in the Garden of Paradise: that man had the right to choose for himself what is good and what is evil, not Almighty God.</p><p>Our Lady has always been instrumental in crushing heresy as the lives of the sainted Pontiffs and the Saints attest. No Saint, Pope or otherwise ever succeeded in stamping out or crushing a heresy in his time without having a special devotion to the Mother of God.</p><p>Pope Pius X invokes the Blessed Virgin Mary by the title Destroyer of all heresies. He took this curious appellation for the gentle, sweet maiden of Nazareth from the Mass of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The title had particular meaning in Pascendi, which was written in 1911 against modernism, the \"synthesis of all heresies.\" Faced with that crisis, it was proper to appeal to the Destroyer of all heresies. The title still applies, however. Indeed, it describes something that has always been true of our Lady  -  and is perhaps even more urgent now.</p><p>Today we see another dimension of Mary as the Destroyer of all heresies: she defends the truth about the human person. Specifically, by her Assumption, she reveals and destroys the error that plagues us now: the error about the human body. Today's heresy (seen most of all in the new Gnosticism of gender ideology) is a recapitulation of an ancient, recurring error. Rather than knowing man to be an embodied soul, we see him as a soul that happens to have (or be trapped in) a body. To be human thus means to be a soul  -  and do with the body as you will. The body becomes a plaything, a tool, a possession, a curse, etc. Indulge it while you are healthy, and discard it when you are not. The body means nothing and tells you nothing about yourself. You can be one thing physically and another spiritually.</p><p>Mary, assumed into heaven, reveals the truth and upends the errors. All saints are in heaven spiritually. They await the last day when their bodies will be raised and reunited with their souls. Our Lady, however, assumed body and soul into heaven, already enjoys perfect blessedness in the fullness of her human nature. In her very being she teaches the essential union of body and soul. Her Assumption has to be understood as one with her entire life. By her Immaculate Conception, Mary is kept free from original sin and its effects. She does not suffer the opposition of body and soul that the rest of us do. Her perpetual virginity further confirms and reveals this perfect union. Her body and soul are so perfectly one that her body participates in and manifests that pure spiritual gift of herself to God.</p>"

    "Mother of Divine Grace": {
        "eng": "<p>\"With me are riches and glory, that I may enrich them that love me.\" These words of Holy Writ are applied to Our Lady, because in her hands are all the riches of Divine Grace, to distribute to the souls that need them. Even before she became the Mother of Him who is the Source and Fountain of all grace, the Angel saluted her as \"full of grace.\"</p><p>How is this? The Saints and Doctors of the Church tell us that she was \"plena sibi,\" full of grace for her own perfection and sanctification, that she might be a worthy tabernacle for the Most High, but by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost, she became \"superplena nobis,\" filled to overflowing for our sake, for it was she who was to bring to us Jesus, the Author and Source of all grace.</p><p>The Saints call her \"the treasurer of divine grace.\" St. Bonaventure says that she is the field mentioned in the Gospel in which was hid the great Treasure, for in her was hidden Jesus Christ, who is the Treasure of God the Father.</p><p>And she herself tells us, in the words of Holy Writ applied to her in the Divine Office, \"In me is all grace of the Way and of the Truth,\" that is, all the grace of Jesus, her Son, who is \"the Way and the Truth.\"</p><p>Observe what happens as soon as Mary receives within her Jesus, the Source of grace. Her very first thought is to bring her grace to others, that they may share in it. She sets out without a moment's delay on the long and toilsome journey to her cousin Elizabeth. \"She went with haste\" and the Gospel tells us that the moment she entered her cousin's dwelling Elizabeth was \"filled with the Holy Ghost,\" that is, with grace.</p><p>St. John, the little unborn babe of Elizabeth, was instantly cleansed from original sin and sanctified, and showed the grace he had received through Mary, by leaping in his mother's womb. We see by this that the very graces which Our Lord is known to have given on earth, after His Incarnation, were given through Mary. Elizabeth says: \"Whence is this to me that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?\" showing that she recognized Mary as the Mother of divine grace. It is, of course, Our Lord who gives all grace, but through Mary. </p><p>St. Bernardine of Siena says: \"From the time when Mary conceived the Incarnate Word, she received from God the privilege, that no one should receive any grace otherwise than through her hands.\"</p><p>\"Fear not,\" said the Angel, \"thou hast found grace.\" Through her, the blessed finder of grace, all we who have lost grace are also to find it.But though Mary is as eager to pour out graces upon us, as she was to bring them to Elizabeth and her household, we also have to do our part.</p><p>It seems to be a universal law in every sphere that \"nothing is to be had for nothing,\" that there is some price, no matter how small, to be paid for every good thing. To have flowers, you must sew seed; to have fruit, you must plant fruit-trees; to be skillful in an art or trade, a good painter, a good musician, a good architect, a good doctor, you must study and practice your profession. So also is it in the Kingdom of Christ.</p><p>In the Gospel, you may observe that, in most of the miracles Our Lord worked, He required some little thing to be done: either the miracle was to be prayed for, as in the case of the ruler's son, or the Canaanite woman's daughter, or the cure of the blind man; or He gave them some small act to do, as for instance, to fill the water-pots with water, before the miraculous wine was given, at the marriage feast of Cana. </p><p>The thing that we have to do, in order to gain grace, is to pray, to pray, above all, to Mary, the Mother of Divine Grace. \"Let us seek grace,\" says St. Bernard, \"but seek it through Mary.\" This does not mean that we are not to ask Our Lord for whatever we need; He is always the Giver of Graces, but it is His will to give them through Mary.</p><p>\"With me are riches and glory,\" says Holy Writ. The supernatural riches of grace are to be had for the asking. Eternal glory is but grace transfigured. What is sanctifying grace in this life is in the next eternal glory. To be enriched by grace we have but to love and pray to Mary.</p><p>At every Mass, the mysteries of the Incarnation and Visitation are renewed for us. Mary at Nazareth said but five little words, and Our Lord was made Man. The priest says but five little words at Mass, and Jesus is there in the host, to be given to each one of us as food, just as once He came to Mary. Mary, the Mother of Divine Grace, is present there as at the Annunciation. But when the mystery of the Visitation is renewed by Our Lord's visit to us in Holy Communion, she, the Mother of Divine Grace, longs to help us to prepare our souls for Jesus, and is anxious that we should lose none of the blessings attached to these golden moments. Think of her at Mass and Holy Communion. Ask her to adorn your souls for Jesus. Put all your communions under the protection of the Mother of Divine Grace.</p><p>When people go to draw water from a well, they can draw only as much as the vessel they bring with them can hold - a thimble will hold a thimbleful, a gallon bucket a gallon. He who brings the largest vessel gets the most water. And it is the same with our souls in Holy Communion. Our Lord is the Fountain of all grace. He has in Himself all grace. He is longing to give it away, to pour it into our souls.</p><p>He gives to each as much as the soul's capacity can hold. If our soul is small and shallow, it can only hold a little grace.</p><p>Now it is by the fervor of the acts we make after Holy Communion that our capacity for grace is increased; every moment we make a fervent, heartfelt act, no matter how simple, we increase as it were the size of our vessel and immediately Jesus fills it, for every act we make then is made in union with His Sacred Heart, and is of infinite value. It is for us then, to beg the Mother of Divine Grace to help us to make our souls wider and deeper, so as to be able to hold all the grace Our Lord is longing to pour into our souls.</p><p>What we must beg of her above all, is to enable us to empty our souls of self and of creatures, for if a wineglass is full of water, and you attempt to pour wine into it, the water will perhaps just be tinged with wine, but most of it will spill and not go into the glass. Just so, some of us only allow Our Lord to give them the merest sprinkling of grace, because their souls are too full of self-love, self-esteem, and selfishness.</p><p>But if Mary is asked to help us to remove the obstacles to grace she will certainly do so.</p>"

He was the pride of his family and looked upon as a prince among his associates. At the age of nineteen he entered the Capuchin Order. He was devoted to Our Lady from childhood and much more so after entering the religious life. After completing his studies he was sent to a monastery in Cadiz. Here he with Father Feliciano erected small shrines to Our Lady along the roadways. They taught the people how to sing the rosary walking along the street. This custom Father Isadore brought with him on returning to Seville. In such a worldly atmosphere this came as a surprise to the people. Cantina and tavern loungers found themselves sliding out the taverns and joining him, to become part of the sheepfold of Mary.</p><p>During one of these street tours Christ's words, \u2018I am the Good Shepherd\" flashed across the Father's mind. That night he had a vision of the Blessed Virgin. She appeared as a young shepherdess with a crook in her hand and a large straw hat falling over her shoulders. The next morning the priest hurried to an artist's shop in a suburb of Seville, telling of his vision; he gave Miquel de Tovar, the artist, an order that a picture be painted of Our Lady as she had appeared to him. \"Our Lady,\" he said, sat on a rock under a tree. Her face radiated divine and tender love. Over a red tunic she wore a jacket of white sheepskin such as shepherds wore; from her shoulders hung a blue mantle. A large straw hat, held by a ribbon, dangled over her left shoulder. Near her right hand was a shepherd's crook, symbolic of the love and care she gives her children. In her left hand she held a rose, while the right hand rested on the head of a lamb, which had sought shelter in her lap. The flock of sheep which surrounded her carried in their mouths - the Virgin's Flower.</p><p>After months, the painting was completed. The admiration of the Spanish for Our Lady as a Divine Shepherdess quickly spread. Practically every church had set aside a corner for the Divine Shepherdess, and the paintings of her became so numerous that the Capuchin Fathers made a collection of them. In the convent in Seville there is today a museum dedicated to this unique and charming representation of Mary. In this museum there is also a fine statue carved by the famous sculptor Francisco Gijon, so natural and so beautiful that it appears almost lifelike. In place of the simple costume of the shepherdess the statue is glorified by a lavish white satin gown. On her dark hair she wears a wide-brimmed straw hat decorated with large daisies. There are also engravings; medals, embroideries and even laces which give evidence of this widespread devotion.</p><p>The details may vary in these works of art, but Our Lady is always recognizable by the presence of a crook and a hat. At times the hat is large and of straw; at other times it is of felt and shaped according to the styles of the day, which gives a uniqueness to this interpretation of the Blessed Mother as the Divine Shepherdess.</p>"

The Dormition of Our Lady.</p><p>\"The holy Apostles held a conference concerning the burial of the most sacred body of their Queen and lady. As they remembered that, according to the custom of the Jews at burial, the deified body of their Master had been anointed with precious ointments and spices and wrapped in the sacred burial cloths; they thought not of doing otherwise with the virginal body of His most holy Mother. Accordingly they called the two maidens, who had assisted the Queen during her life and who had been designated as the heiresses of her tunics, and instructed them to anoint the body of the Mother of God with highest reverence and modesty and wrap it in the winding-sheets before it should be placed in the casket.</p><p>With great reverence and fear the two maidens entered the room, where the body of the blessed Lady lay upon its couch; but the refulgence issuing from it barred and blinded them in such a manner that they could neither see nor touch the body, nor even ascertain in what particular place it rested.</p><p>In fear and reverence still greater than on their entrance, the maidens left the room; and in great excitement and wonder they told the Apostles what had happened. They, not without divine inspiration, came to the conclusion, that this Ark of the covenant was not to be touched or handled in the common way. Then saint Peter and saint John entered the oratory and perceived the effulgence, and at the same time they heard the celestial music of the angels, who were singing: \"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\" Others responded: \"A Virgin before childbirth, in childbirth and after childbirth.\" From that time on many of the faithful expressed their devotion toward the most blessed Mary in these words of praise; and from them they were handed down to be repeated by us with the approbation of the holy Church.</p><p>The two holy Apostles, saint peter and saint John, were for a time lost in admiration at what they saw and heard of their Queen; and in order to decide what to do, they sank on their knees, beseeching the Lord to make it known. Then they heard a voice saying: \"Let not the sacred body be either uncovered or touched.\"</p><p>Having thus been informed of the will of God, they brought a bier, and, the effulgence having diminished somewhat, they approached the couch and with their own hands reverently took hold of the tunic at the two ends. Thus, without changing its posture, they raised the sacred and virginal Treasure and placed it on the bier in the same position as it had occupied on the couch. They could easily do this, because they felt no more weight than that of the tunic. On this bier the former effulgence of the body moderated still more, and all of them, by disposition of the Lord and for the consolation of all those present, could now perceive and study the beauty of that virginal countenance and of her hands. As for the rest, the omnipotence of God protected this his heavenly dwelling, so that neither in life nor in death any one should behold any other part except what is common in ordinary conversation, namely, her most inspiring countenance, by which She had been known, and her hands, by which She had labored.</p><p>Then the Apostles consulted further about her burial. Their decision becoming known among the multitudes of the faithful in Jerusalem, they brought many candles to be lighted at the bier, and it happened that all the lights burned through that day and the two following days without any of the candles being consumed or wasted in any shape or manner.</p><p>The Apostles took upon their shoulders the sacred body and the tabernacle of God and, as priests of the evangelical law, bore the Propitiatory of the divine oracles and blessings in orderly procession from the Cenacle in the city to the valley of Josaphat. This was the visible accompaniment of the dwellers of Jerusalem. But besies this there was another invisible multitude, that of the courtiers of heaven. It was composed of the thousand angels of the Queen, continuing their celestial songs, which were heard by the Apostles and disciples and many others, and which sweetly continued for three days. In addition to these many other spirits had descended from heaven, namely, many thousands or legions of angels with the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets, among whom were saint Joachim saint Anne, saint Joseph, saint Elizabeth and the Baptist and numerous other saints, who were sent by our Savior Jesus to assist at the exequies and burial of His most blessed Mother.</p><p>When the procession came to the holy sepulcher in the valley of Josaphat, the same two Apostles, saint Peter and saint John, who had laid the celestial Treasure from the couch onto the bier, with joyful reverence placed it in the sepulcher and covered it with a linen cloth, the hands of the angels performing more of these last rites than the hands of the Apostles. They closed up the sepulcher with a large stone, according to custom at other burials. The celestial courtiers returned to heaven, while the thousand angels of the Queen continued their watch, guarding the sacred body and keeping up the music as at her burial. The concourse of the people lessened and the holy Apostles and disciples, dissolved in tender tears, returned to the Cenacle.</p>"

    "Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary": {
        "eng": "<p><b>History Of The Feast</b></p><p>Even though we cannot trace the celebration of the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary back any further than the sixth century, the source for the story of the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary is much older. The earliest documented version is found in the Protoevangelium of James, an apocryphal gospel written about A.D.150. From the Protoevangelium of James, we learn the names of Mary's parents, Joachim and Anna, as well as the tradition that the couple was childless until an angel appeared to Anna and told her that she would conceive. (Many of the same details appear also in the later apocryphal Gospel of the Nativity of Mary.)</p><p><b>The Reason For The Date</b></p><p>The traditional date of the feast, September 8, falls exactly nine months after the feast of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Perhaps because of its close proximity to the feast of the Assumption of Mary, the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary is not celebrated today with the same solemnity as the Immaculate Conception. It is, nonetheless, a very important feast, because it prepares the way for the birth of Christ. It is also an unusual feast, because it celebrates a birthday.</p><p><b>Why Do We Celebrate The Blessed Virgin Mary's Birthday?</b></p><p>The feasts of saints are traditionally celebrated on the day of their death, because that is the date on which they entered into eternal life. And, indeed, we also celebrate the Blessed Virgin Mary's entrance into Heaven on August 15, the Feast of the Assumption.</p><p>There are only three people whose birthdays have traditionally been celebrated by Christians. Jesus Christ, at Christmas; Saint John the Baptist; and the Blessed Virgin Mary. And we celebrate all three birthdays for the same reason: All three were born without Original Sin. Christ, because He was conceived by the Holy Spirit; Mary, because she was kept free from the stain of Original Sin by the action of God in His foreknowledge that she would agree to be the mother of Christ; and Saint John, because he was blessed in the womb by the presence of his Savior when Mary, pregnant with Jesus, came to aid her cousin Elizabeth in the final months of Elizabeth's pregnancy (an event we celebrate in the Feast of the Visitation).</p>"

        "eng": "<p>This feast, observed throughout the Western Church on October 11, honor Mary as Mother of God, and bears the same sort of relation to the Annunciation and to Christmas as does the Synaxis of Our Lady in the Byzantine rite. It was long known in Portugal and elsewhere, but was finally instituted in 1931 by Pope Pius XI in view of the fifteenth centenary of the Council of Ephesus.</p><p>At the same time the Pope ordered at his own cost the restoration of the Marian mosaics in Saint Mary Major, much decayed through age. He issued an encyclical letter, \"Lux veritatis.\" In this, among the objects of the new festival, is named one truth that was particularly close to the heart of Pius XI, \"\u2026that Mary, who is loved and revered so warmly by the separated Christians of the East, would not suffer them to wander and be unhappily led further away from the unity of the Church, and therefore from her Son, whose vicar on earth we are.\"</p><p>\"On this occasion the heavenly Lady was full of the Holy Ghost and moreover bore within Her, as His Mother, the Divine Word, who proceeds from the Father and the Holy Ghost. Saint Joseph received special enlightenment and the plenitude of divine graces, and altogether renewed in fervor of spirit he said:</p><p>\"Blessed art Thou, Lady, among all women, fortunate and preferred before all nations and generations. May the Creator of heaven and earth be extolled with eternal praise, since from his exalted kingly throne He has looked upon Thee and chosen Thee for his dwelling place and in Thee alone has fulfilled the ancient promises made to the Patriarchs and Prophets. Let all generations bless Him: for in no one has He magnified his name as He has done in thy humility; and me, the most insignificant of the living, He has in his divine condescension selected for thy servant.\"</p><p>In these words of praise and benediction Saint Joseph was enlightened by the Holy Ghost, in the same manner as Saint Elizabeth, when she responded to the salutation of Our Queen and Mistress. The light and inspiration, received by the most holy spouse was wonderfully adapted to his dignity and office. The heavenly Lady, upon hearing the words of the holy man, answered in the words of the Magnificat, as She had done on her visit to Saint Elizabeth, and She added other canticles. She was all aflame in ecstasy and was raised from the earth in a globe of light, which surrounded Her and transfigured Her with the gifts of glory.</p><p>At this heavenly vision Saint Joseph was filled with admiration and unspeakable delight; for never had he seen his most blessed Spouse in such eminence of glory and perfection. Now he beheld Her with a full and clear understanding, since all the integrity and purity of the Princess of heaven and mystery of her dignity manifested themselves to him. He saw and recognized in her virginal womb the humanity of the infant God and the union of the two natures of the Word. With profound humility and reverence he adored Him and recognized Him as his Redeemer, offering himself to his majesty. The Lord looked upon him in benevolence and kindness as upon no other man, for He accepted him as his foster-father and conferred upon him that title. In accordance with this dignity, He gifted him with that plenitude of science and heavenly gifts which Christian piety can and must acknowledge.</p>"

    "Feast of the Visitation of Our Lady": {
        "eng": "<p>Mary's first thought after the Archangel's visit was to hasten to the little city of Ain Kharin and congratulate her cousin Elizabeth on the wonderful event about to take place. As Mary hastened along, those who met her little realized that she bore the Son of God - outwardly humble, sweet, and gracious to all.</p><p>So the little girl from Nazareth passed unobserved upon her way. But as she raised her voice in loving salutation to Elizabeth, when entering the house, a marvelous thing happened, for the unborn infant in Elizabeth's womb leaped for joy as he heard the voice of God's Mother sounding in his ears. Elizabeth, stricken with amazement, cried out:</p><p>\"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.\"</p><p>In that instant Elizabeth knew that she was standing in the presence of God; knew that the little girl standing before her was God's Mother; knew all that had taken place at Nazareth; knew of Mary's fiat.</p><p>Then Mary lifted up her voice in high thanksgiving and gave forth the marvelous canticle:</p><p>\"My soul doth magnify the Lord. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior. Because He hath regarded the humility of His handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. Because He that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and holy is His name. And His mercy is from Generation unto generations, to them that fear Him. He hath shewed might in His arm: He hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart. He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich He hath sent empty away. He hath received Israel His servant, being mindful of His mercy: As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.\"</p><p>In this Magnificat of the humble little girl of Nazareth there is an intense personal note; she sees why it is that she is exalted - her humility. She prophesies as well as she sings, and foretells her future glory. Then she tells that God's mercy follows those that fear Him; she sings of God's might; she returns to the thought of God's mercy, and with this mercy in mind, the little virgin ends her triumphant song.</p><p>For three months Mary and Elizabeth rejoiced in each other's company and gave thanks to God for all the wonderful mercy He had bestowed on them - one, the mother of the Herald of God, the other, the Mother of God Himself. Yet these months saw nothing outwardly extraordinary; it was just the quiet outwardly ordinary daily round, such as might be seen in any family.</p><p>After those three months the Virgin set out on her way home to Nazareth, and her return was as little noted as her going. She came full of joy and she returned full of joy, for no hint of coming sorrow cast a shadow upon her.This Feast of the Visitation of Our Lady was instituted by Urban IV, in the year 1385, and confirmed by Boniface IX, in the year 1389.</p>"

    "Collection of all the Feasts of Our Lady": {
        "eng": "<p>Louvain refers to Leuven, the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in the Flemish Region of Belgium. There was once a chapel called Notre-Dame de Leuven, or Our Lady of Louvain, which had stood near the church tower of a separate church dedicated to Saint Peter. The chapel owed its origin to an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary that was given by a group of monks from Abbey Park as a sign of brotherhood in the year 1132.</p><p>According to tradition, the wooden statue, which depicted the Blessed Virgin seated with the Divine Child in her lap, was a gift from heaven deposited on the earth by heavenly angels. The image excited a lively religious fervor upon its reception, and there are numerous miracles credited to pious devotion to the image of Our Lady of Louvain.</p><p>Over 350 years later, as the chapel of Our Lady of Louvain was built on land that was needed for the construction of the new, and larger, church of Saint Peter, it was necessary to demolish the chapel. In a letter dated March 28, 1496, Bishop John Horne of Liege, authorized the transfer of materials from the chapel of Our Lady of Louvain to the new basilica of Saint Pierre. The old chapel was demolished two years later in 1498, and the statue of the Virgin was placed on a special altar in the collegiate church of Saint Peter. Every year, on the eve of the first Sunday in September, the miraculous image of Our Lady of Louvain had been carried in procession by the canons and members of the magistrate while bells tolled and musicians accompanied the image singing the Salve Regina. Some time later the statue became known by the title of Notre-Dame-sous-la-Tour.</p><p>The original church of Saint Peter was made entirely of wood, and completed in about 986. It burned to the ground in 1176. It was rebuilt in Romanesque style with a crypt at the back in the choir. The church had two west towers, and that image is still used as the ancient seal for the city. The church was then enlarged in 1425 in the Brabantine Gothic style. The church of Saint Peter was heavily damaged in both world wars, but most importantly, the original statue of Our Lady of Louvain was completely destroyed in 1944 from allied bombing during World War II, and it is now only a replica that is on display at the church.</p>"

    "Finding in the Temple": {
        "eng": "<p>When Jesus was twelve years old, in the eyes of the Law considered a man, he attended the Temple with His parents. His parents thought He was with them in the caravan, visiting friends or relatives. Women were placed in the center of the caravan; men and boys in the front of the back to protect the women. It was not until the end of the day that Mary and Joseph sought Jesus among their relatives and could not find him. Since they could not find him, they returned to Jerusalem in an agony of heart to search for their beloved Son.</p><p>On the third day with growing anxiety, they came to God's Temple to tell Him their sorrow and to plead for His mercy. Hardly had they returned to the Temple when they heard His voice, and God revealed to them the Child they had so diligently searched for all these worried days. Loving Mother that she is, Mary knew that her Son had good reason for his actions, but she was overcome with the pain of her emotions. Mary asked: \"Son, why hast thou done so to us?\" These words were forced from her by pain at the absence of her Son, Whom she loved above all things, and not by indignation, for He was blameless.</p><p>Christ was not unsympathetic to His parent's grief. He knew what they had suffered for three days, yet he had remained in Jerusalem because of His love of prayer and communion with His Heavenly Father. He also showed them, even then, some rays of His divinity, by which to make known that He had come for the glory of His Father, and to procure our salvation. The glory of God and the salvation of our souls should be our chief object in life. So, He reminded his parents kindly that He must be about His Father's business, and they returned to their home, and He was subject to them.</p>"

    "Gate of Heaven": {
        "eng": "<p>Observe that the Church teaches us to pray for Our Lady's help at two moments - \"now,\" that is, at the present moment, the only one that is in our power; \"and at the hour of our death,\" because that moment may not be in our power - we may not be able to help ourselves at all by prayer when we lie in our last agony. But if Our Lady, the Gate of Heaven, is praying for us, we have every hope and chance of gaining Heaven through Her.</p><p>Mary is also called the \"Gate of Heaven,\" because Our Lord is in Heaven, and She is the way to Him. A holy soul used to say this prayer: O Jesus, in Thy dear Sacrament, Thy Heaven I cannot see. But Heaven is everywhere Thou art, and Thou art Heaven to me.</p><p>Now this is fulfilled, not only in our Lord having taken flesh from her, and being her Son, but, moreover, in that she had a place in the economy of Redemption; it is fulfilled in her spirit and will, as well as in her body. Eve had a part in the fall of man, though it was Adam who was our representative, and whose sin made us sinners. It was Eve who began, and who tempted Adam. Scripture says: \"The woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold; and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband, and he did eat.\" It was fitting then in God's mercy that, as the woman began the destruction of the world, so woman should also begin its recovery, and that, as Eve opened the way for the fatal deed of the first Adam, so Mary should open the way for the great achievement of the second Adam, even our Lord Jesus Christ, who came to save the world by dying on the cross for it. Hence Mary is called by the holy Fathers a second and a better Eve, as having taken that first step in the salvation of mankind which Eve took in its ruin.</p><p>How, and when, did Mary take part, and the initial part, in the world's restoration? It was when the Angel Gabriel came to her to announce to her the great dignity which was to be her portion. St. Paul bids us \"present our bodies to God as a reasonable service.\" We must not only pray with our lips, and fast, and do outward penance, and be chaste in our bodies; but we must be obedient, and pure in our minds. And so, as regards the Blessed Virgin, it was God's will that she should undertake willingly and with full understanding to be the Mother of our Lord, and not to be a mere passive instrument whose maternity would have no merit and no reward. The higher our gifts, the heavier our duties. It was no light lot to be so intimately near to the Redeemer of men, as she experienced afterwards when she suffered with him. Therefore, weighing well the Angel's words before giving her answer to them - first she asked whether so great an office would be a forfeiture of that Virginity which she had vowed. When the Angel told her no, then, with the full consent of a full heart, full of God's love to her and her own lowliness, she said, \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done unto me according to thy word.\" It was by this consent that she became the Gate of Heaven.A gate is the entrance you pass through to get from one place to another. Mary is \"the closed gate\" of the Prophet Ezechiel, that the prince only could pass through. \"This gate shall be closed, it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass through it, because the Lord God of Israel hath entered in by it, and it shall be shut for the prince.\" (Ezech. 44: 2-3)</p><p>As Our Lord came to us through Mary, so must we go to Him through Her. We must think of Mary as the \"Gate of Heaven\" not only for us, the Church Militant, but also for the Church Suffering - the poor souls in Purgatory, who cannot help themselves. Through Her prayers many a soul may at this very moment be passing through the Gate of Heaven.</p>"

The sacred image is found in a church in Genazzano, a beautiful town thirty miles south-east of Rome. The church dedicated to the Mother of Good Counsel was built there in the fourth century. In 1356 the church was given over to the Augustinians. Restoration started in 1467, when a widow, Petruccia, sold all her belongings to help finance the project. However, funds ran out before the task was completed.</p><p>That same year, all the residents of Genazzano heard a beautiful melody coming from heaven. As they looked up, they saw a white, shining cloud that descended on the church of the Mother of Good Counsel. The cloud gradually vanished, revealing a beautiful painting of Our Lady tenderly holding her Divine Son in her arms. Immediately, Mary began to cure the sick and grant countless graces.</p><p>The news spread throughout the country. Two Albanians from Scutari  appeared in the town with a curious tale. They had fled from their homeland to escape the invading Turks. Before fleeing, they had stopped in the church and had seen how the icon of Our Lady, wrapped in a white cloud, lifted off the wall on which it had hung for two centuries. They followed the picture until they could see the towers of Rome, when it suddenly disappeared. The mysterious icon of Genezzano was identical to the one in the church in Scutari.</p><p>The amazing news reached Rome. Pope Paul II sent two bishops to investigate the story. The prelates reported that 171 miracles were recorded in the months following the icon's appearance. The pope's commission also found that there was an empty space on the church wall at Scutari. An icon that had been venerated there for centuries was, indeed, missing.</p><p>The image was painted on a sheet of plaster so thin that it would have been impossible for any human hand to remove it without damage. It had survived the subsequent centuries through the tumult of several earthquakes and withstood the bombing during World War II. Several altars were destroyed, walls caved in, and the roof was crushed. The icon, only yards away from the explosion, remained intact.</p><p>In 1753, Pope Benedict XIV established the Pious Union of Our Lady of Good Counsel to promote devotion to Mary under this title. Pope Leo XIII added the title Mother of Good Counsel to the Litany of Loreto. Pope Pius XII dedicated his term of office to Our Lady of Good Counsel. And Pope John XXIII visited her shrine to pray for the success of the Second Vatican Council.</p><p>The icon at Genazzano is about a foot wide and eighteen inches high. It depicts a mother figure that is half turned toward her son and half toward the viewer, reflecting Mary's concern for both Jesus and his Church</p>"

    "Health of the Sick": {
        "eng": "<p>Art has been very fond of St. Joachim and St. Ann, the parents of Our Lady. It sensed the deep affection of that religious family. Joachim and Ann took good care of their Heaven-sent child. It was but a fair return that She take care if them, already old when She was born. It is no stretch of imagination for us to see Mary waiting hand and foot on the old couple, sitting by their sick-bed and folding their hands in death.</p><p>More so with St. Joseph. Theirs was a virgin marriage, but as it is souls that love, not bodies, their mutual love was the greatest love-match the world has ever seen. St. Joseph is the Patron of the Dying because Jesus and Mary sat by his sick-bed, his death-bed. Mary wet his parched lips, smoothed his pillow, kept vigil through the night, folded his hands, and closed his eyes. One likes to think that it is in memory of that, that She is first called \"Health of the Sick,\" that Her love followed Joseph to the grave and after.</p><p>But it was as Mother -  Mother of God - that Mary was consecrated \"Health of the Sick.\" Jesus was immune to sickness and death, but He willed that He be struck as a leper, and He died. Who will try to estimate the source of strength Mary was to Him in His dereliction, in His scourging, His crowning with thorns, His way of the Cross, and finally in the three-hour passion and death? Every line of the Stabat Mater is a commentary on Her title - \"Health of the Sick,\" with its final prayer for a happy death, applying to us: \"Christ when Thou shalt call me hence, be Thy Mother my defense; be Thy Cross my victory. While my body here decays, may my soul Thy goodness praise, safe in Paradise with Thee.\" And \"Health of the Sick\" (Salus Infirmorum) primarily means our eternal health, our eternal salvation - for salus means not only \"health,\" but \"salvation.\"</p><p>That Mary should have a special love for the sick was necessary if She was to follow the example of Jesus. He was the Divine Physician for bodies as well as souls. To narrate the many cures of the sick by Him and His Disciples would be to quote most of the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. He had come to destroy sin; He had sympathy for the sickness which man had brought upon himself by original sin. The healing of the sick man was not only a proof of His Divine Mission, a proof that He was Lord of Life and Death, and therefore God, but also a work of pure Mercy, the compulsion of His love. His love for the sick was so great that He instituted the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, one of the purposes of which is to restore the body to health, if it is to the spiritual benefit of the patient.</p><p>While on earth, Our Lady was ever kind to the sick. She has not ceased to help them now that She is in Heaven. The lives of the Saints are filled with manifestations of Her power over sickness. We have but to remember the case of the Little Flower. When she was a little girl she was given up for dead, but the statue of the Blessed Virgin smiled upon her and she was instantly restored to health, in order to work out her life of extraordinary sanctity. In that instance Mary was, as St. Ephrem calls Her - \"the joy of the sick.\" The restoration of health to the little Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was not only for the welfare of her soul but for the greater glory of God. That cannot always be said. Many a sickness is a true blessing from God. St. Thomas More, when he was in prison waiting for death, wrote a book - \"The Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation.\" It is one of the loveliest spiritual books ever written. One thought of his is this: \"How many men attain health of body, that were better for their souls' health their bodies were sick still.\" Mary does not make such mistakes. She is concerned with what is effective for the soul's salvation.</p><p>Health of body, yes; Mary wants us to have that, as Her Divine Son gave health of body. But most of all, She wants for us health of soul. Salus means salvation. And She who cooperated in the Redemption wants to see us healed of the disease of soul. Father Damien became a martyr to disease for love of God and love of souls. The world honors his memory because he saved bodies and eased their torments. More than all he gave his life for souls. But what was Father Damien in his zeal for souls compared with Our Lady? There is an old Irish prayer that runs - \"O Lady, Physician of the most miserable diseases, behold the many ulcers of my soul.\" So St. Simon Stock called Her - \"Medicine of sinners,\" as St. Ephrem called Her \"Robust health for those who have recourse to Her.\" Thus the Church applies to Her the words of Proverbs - (8: 3, 5) \"He that shall find Me shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord.\"</p><p>Mary is called the Cedar of Lebanon. It is interesting to note that healing virtues were attributed to this tree. St. Bernard has among his beautiful tributes to Her, this one: \"O Mother of God, Thou dost not disdain a sinner, however loathsome he may be: if he send up his sighs to Thee, Thou wilt deliver him with Thine own hand from despair.\" We can learn from Our Lady\"s love for the sick.</p>"

He caused the combined forces of Christendom to turn against the enemy in what was then called the Holy League, and then asked all of Christendom to pray the Rosary for their success. The Christians were inferior in numbers to the vast army and navy of the Turks, but the former bravely advanced under Don Juan of Austria while placing their trust in the help of the Blessed Virgin.</p><p>The enemy was routed at Lepanto after five hours of struggle while the Holy Father knelt praying before a picture of Our Blessed Lady. Suddenly the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared in a vision and told the pope that in that very hour the enemy had been defeated. The Ottoman Turks had not been defeated in a major naval engagement during the memory of any living man, and the loss is thought to have been as decisive to world history as was the Roman Battle of Actium fought in 31 BC. Saint Pope Pius V then ordained that the invocation \"Help of Christians\" be added to the Litany of Loreto.</p><p>Some years later the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte took the Papal States and had Pope Pius VII confined to prison, to the great sorrow of the entire Church. The pope remained captive for five years beginning in 1808 when Our Lady once more came to the aid of her faithful children; the Emperor was forced to abdicate and was himself exiled to the island of Elba. The Holy Father returned to Rome in a triumphal procession in which many images of the Blessed Virgin were crowned along the way to the Vatican.</p><p>Pope Pius VII in thanksgiving for his deliverance, crowned with his own hands the picture of Our Lady venerated at Savona, where he was first imprisoned; and ordained that the twenty-fourth of May should be kept as a special feast in Mary's honor, under the title of \"Help of Christians.\"</p>"

She is compared to gold because it is the most precious metal. \"Therefore it is that Mary too is called golden; because her graces, her virtues, her innocence, her purity, are of that transcendent brilliancy and dazzling perfection.\" But she is more than this; she is a House of Gold or Golden Palace because \"She is the house and the palace of the Great King, of God Himself.\" Jesus was born in this holy house; he took his flesh and blood from this house.</p><p>WHY is she called a House? And why is she called Golden? Gold is the most beautiful, the most valuable, of all metals. Silver, copper, and steel may in their way be made good to the eye, but nothing is so rich, so splendid, as gold. We have few opportunities of seeing it in any quantity; but anyone who has seen a large number of bright gold coins knows how magnificent is the look of gold. Hence it is that in Scripture the Holy City is, by a figure of speech, called Golden. \"The City,\" says St. John, \"was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.\" He means of course to give us a notion of the wondrous beautifulness of heaven, by comparing it with what is the most beautiful of all the substances which we see on earth.</p><p>Therefore it is that Mary too is called golden; because her graces, her virtues, her innocence, her purity, are of that transcendent brilliancy and dazzling perfection, so costly, so exquisite, that the angels cannot, so to say, keep their eyes off her any more than we could help gazing upon any great work of gold.</p><p>But observe further, she is a golden house, or, I will rather say, a golden palace. Let us imagine we saw a whole palace or large church all made of gold, from the foundations to the roof; such, in regard to the number, the variety, the extent of her spiritual excellences, is Mary.</p><p>But why called a house or palace? And whose palace? She is the house and the palace of the Great King, of God Himself. Our Lord, the Co-equal Son of God, once dwelt in her. He was her Guest; nay, more than a guest, for a guest comes into a house as well as leaves it. But our Lord was actually born in this holy house. He took His flesh and His blood from this house, from the flesh, from the veins of Mary. Rightly then was she made to be of pure gold, because she was to give of that gold to form the body of the Son of God. She was golden in her conception, golden in her birth. She went through the fire of her suffering like gold in the furnace, and when she ascended on high, she was, in the words of our hymn,<br/>Above all the Angels in glory untold,                     <br/>Standing next to the King in a vesture of gold.</p>"

It was Mary's love for man, joined with and flowing from her love of God, that made her utter her \"Fiat\" - that Fiat meant consent to the Incarnation and to the Redemption. So also the Salvation of the world depends on Mary.</p><p>Among Our Lady's urgent requests at Fatima was the plea for devotion and consecration to her Immaculate Heart - our devotion to Mary is neither complete nor true, unless we are willing to give ourselves over to the object of our love; true devotion culminates in dedication or consecration. Consecration consists in an act, by which we promise Our Lady not only everything we possess, but our very selves as well; and this, not for a time, but forever; secondly, it is a state whereby we recognize God's sovereign dominion by acknowledging Christ as our King, and Our Lady as our Queen, pledging them complete service and devotion.</p><p>Our consecration, then, must be more than a well-written prayer, recited and then forgotten; it must be a vital, living state in which we recognize the importance of habitually belonging to Our Lady; to be fruitful it must inspire imitation. We must try to reshape our lives according to Our Lady's, setting up a whole new pattern, studied at her feet, learned from the Rosary mysteries and modeled after her own Immaculate Heart.</p><p>To consecrate means to remove from the profane and set apart as sacred; renouncing self-love; doing all in union with and for our Heavenly Queen; removing sin and all obstacles to perfect union of heart with hers. If we do this, Mary will teach us all virtue and the way that will lead us to God. If men become slaves to an art which ends with death, should we not become slaves of Mary, the music of whose Heart will sing out for all Eternity?</p><p>Love will prompt this total submission, solid love of the will, ending in imitation and surrender. Our love for Mary must be so intense that we chain our hearts to hers by golden links of love, stronger than any base metal of earth; Mary will then govern our thoughts, words, deeds. Our life will have but one purpose - God's glory. Our hearts will yearn only for her interests and her honor - which is God's honor, too; all her intentions and dispositions will become ours. Her humility will replace our pride; her purity efface our impurity; her selflessness, wipe out our self-love; and all her virtues replace our sins. From her we will learn the meaning of prayer, mortification, and penance. Resting close to her Immaculate Heart, our own cold hears will become enkindled with the Divine Fire and grow ablaze with her burning love.</p><p>Our lives thus surrendered to her can become like that of the angels, one continual song of praise; our hearts annihilated and lost within the sanctuary of her Immaculate Heart, will be able to sing truly, \"My soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.\"</p>"

    "The Immaculate Heart": {
        "eng": "<p>The history of the devotion to the Heart of Mary is connected on many points with that to the Heart of Jesus; nevertheless, it has its own history which, although very simple, is not devoid of interest. The attention of Christians was early attracted by the love and virtues of the Heart of Mary. The Gospel itself invited this attention with exquisite discretion and delicacy. What was first excited was compassion for the Virgin Mother. It was, so to speak, at the foot of the Cross that the Christian heart first made the acquaintance of the Heart of Mary. Simeon's prophecy paved the way and furnished the devotion with one of its favourite formulae and most popular representations: the heart pierced with a sword. But Mary was not merely passive at the foot of the Cross; \"she cooperated through charity\", as St. Augustine says, \"in the work of our redemption\".Another Scriptural passage to help in bringing out the devotion was the twice-repeated saying of St. Luke, that Mary kept all the sayings and doings of Jesus in her heart, that there she might ponder over them and live by them. A few of the Virgin's sayings, also recorded in the Gospel, particularly the Magnificat, disclose new features in Marian psychology. Some of the Fathers also throw light upon the psychology of the Virgin, for instance, St. Ambrose, when in his commentary on St. Luke he holds Mary up as the ideal of virginity, and St. Ephrem, when he so poetically sings of the coming of the Magi and the welcome accorded them by the humble Mother. Little by little, in consequence of the application of the Canticle of the loving relations between God and the Blessed Virgin, the Heart of Mary came to be for the Christian Church the Heart of the Spouse of the Canticles as well as the Heart of the Virgin Mother. Some passages from other Sapiential Books, likewise understood as referring to Mary, in whom they personify wisdom and her gentle charms, strengthened this impression. Such are the texts in which wisdom is presented as the mother lofty love, of fear, of knowledge, and of holy hope. In the New Testament Elizabeth proclaims Mary blessed because she has believed the words of the angel; the Magnificat is an expression of her humility; and in answering the woman of the people, who in order to exalt the Son proclaimed the Mother blessed, did not Jesus himself say: \"Blessed rather are they that hear the word of God and keep it\", thus in a manner inviting us to seek in Mary that which had so endeared her to God and caused her to be selected as the Mother of Jesus? The Fathers understood His meaning, and found in these words a new reason for praising Mary. St. Leo says that through faith and love she conceived her Son spiritually, even before receiving Him into her womb, and St. Augustine tells us that she was more blessed in having borne Christ in her heart than in having conceived Him in the flesh.</p><p>It is only in the twelfth, or towards the end of the eleventh century, that slight indications of a regular devotion are perceived in a sermon by St. Bernard (De duodecim stellis), from which an extract has been taken by the Church and used in the Offices of the Compassion and of the Seven Dolours. Stronger evidences are discernible in the pious meditations on the Ave Maria and the Salve Regina, usually attributed either to St. Anselm of Lucca (d. 1080) or St. Bernard; and also in the large book \"De laudibus B. Mariae Virginis\" (Douai, 1625) by Richard de Saint-Laurent. Penitentiary of Rouen in the thirteenth century. In St. Mechtilde (d. 1298) and St. Gertrude (d. 1302) the devotion had two earnest adherents. A little earlier it had been included by St. Thomas Becket in the devotion to the joys and sorrows of Mary, by Blessed Hermann (d. 1245), one of the first spiritual children of St. Dominic, in his other devotions to Mary, and somewhat later it appeared in St. Bridget's \"Book of Revelations\". Tauler (d. 1361) beholds in Mary the model of a mystical, just as St. Ambrose perceived in her the model of a virginal soul. St. Bernardine of Siena (d. 1444) was more absorbed in the contemplation of the virginal heart, and it is from him that the Church has borrowed the lessons of the Second Nocturn for the feast of the Heart of Mary. St. Francis de Sales speaks of the perfections of this heart, the model of love for God, and dedicated to it his \"Theotimus\".</p><p>During this same period one finds occasional mention of devotional practices to the Heart of Mary, e.g. in the \"Antidotarium\" of Nicolas du Saussay (d. 1488), in Julius II, and in the \"Pharetra\" of Lanspergius. In the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth, ascetic authors dwelt upon this devotion at greater length. It was, however, reserved to St. Jean Eudes (d. 1681) to propagate the devotion, to make it public, and to have a feast celebrated in honor of the Heart of Mary, first at Autun in 1648 and afterwards in a number of French dioceses. He established several religious societies interested in upholding and promoting the devotion, of which his large book on the Coeur Admirable (Admirable Heart), published in 1681, resembles a summary. P\u00e8re Eudes' efforts to secure the approval of an Office and feast failed at Rome, but, notwithstanding, this disappointment, the devotion to the Heart of Mary progressed. In 1699 Father Pinamonti (d. 1703) published in Italian his beautiful little work on the Holy Heart of Mary, and in 1725 P\u00e8re de Gallifet combined the cause of the Heart of Mary with that of the Heart of Jesus in order to obtain Rome's approbation of the two devotions and the institution of the two feasts. In 1729 his project was defeated, and in 1765 the two causes were separated, to assure the success of the principal one.</p><p>In 1799 Pius VI, then in captivity at Florence, granted the Bishop of Palermo the feast of the Most Pure Heart of Mary for some of the churches in his diocese. In 1805 Pius VII made a new concession, thanks to which the feast was soon widely observed. Such was the existing condition when a twofold movement, started in Paris, gave fresh impetus to the devotion. The two factors of this movement were first of all the revelation of the \"miraculous medal\" in 1830 and all the prodigies that followed, and then the establishment at Notre-Dame-des-Victoires of the Archconfraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners, which spread rapidly throughout the world and was the source of numberless graces. On 21 July, 1855, the Congregation of Rites finally approved the Office and Mass of the Most Pure Heart of Mary without, however, imposing them upon the Universal Church.</p><p>Devotion to the Heart of Jesus is especially directed to the Divine Heart as overflowing with love for men, and it presents this love to us as despised and outraged. In the devotion to the Heart of Mary, on the other hand, what seems to attract us above all else is the love of this Heart for Jesus and for God. Its love for men is not overlooked, but it is not so much in evidence nor so dominant. With this difference is linked another. The first, act of the devotion to the Heart of Jesus is the love eager to respond to love, in devotion to the Heart of Mary there is no first act so clearly indicated: in this devotion, perhaps, study and imitation hold as important a place as love. For, although this study and imitation are impregnated with filial affection, the devotion presents itself with no object sufficiently conspicuous to call forth our love, which is, on the contrary, naturally awakened and increased by the study and imitation. Hence, accurately speaking, love is more the result than the object of the devotion, the object being rather to love God, and Jesus better by uniting ourselves to Mary for this purpose and by imitating her virtues. It would also seem that, although in the devotion to the Heart of Mary the heart has an essential part as symbol and sensible object, it does not stand out as prominently as in the devotion to the Heart of Jesus; we think rather of the thing symbolized, of love, virtues, and sentiments, of Mary's interior life.</p>"

They were all women dedicated to prayer who sought to serve God in spirit and in truth, but the order especially honors the Blessed Virgin in the mystery of the Visitation.</p><p>Initially, the order had no name, but was formed as a refuge for women who desired to dedicate their lives to doing works of charity. It began with four religious in a house that Saint Francis de Sales provided the new order that was located close to Lake Annecy, and soon there were ten more who joined as novices. St Francis decided upon the name of the order.</p><p>As often happens with works that are pleasing to God, the Order of the Visitation met with some opposition. Certain modifications were made, and St Francis wrote a book named Treatise on the Love of God as a guide for the more advanced sisters. The foremost virtue he exhorted the sisters to practice was humility, as he said himself, \"humility is the fountain of all other virtues; don't limit humility, make of it the principal one of all your actions.\"</p><p>Saint Jane Frances de Chantal was a personal friend of St Francis de Sales, and she governed the new order of sisters wisely under the direction of St Francis. Soon there were other convents at Lyons, Bourges, Grenoble and even Paris. Saint Jane Frances founded the convent in Paris amid certain opposition, yet she gained the acceptance of her detractors through the grace of God and her own patient humility. It was in Paris that she met St Vincent de Paul. The Order spread throughout Europe, and even came to the United States in the year 1883.</p>"

    "Institution of the Angelus of Our Lady": {
        "eng": "<p>The institution of the Angelus occurred June 28-29, about 1456 by Pope Callistus. The Turks had been threatening Europe and it was the Pope's request that the Faithful recite the Angelus for the safety of Christendom against the Turks, and for peace.The Angelus was first recited about sunset, a general practice throughout Europe in the first half of the 14th century, recommended by Pope John XXI. The morning Angelus seems to have started somewhat later, again, for peace. The recitation of the midday Angelus began sometime in the 14th or 15th century; it was called the \"Peace Bell.\"</p><p>This present-day custom of reciting the Angelus is a short practice of devotion in honor of the Incarnation, repeated three times each day, morning, noon, and evening, at the sound of the church bell. It is curious how the Angelus is associated historically with the invasion of the Turks, again, in 1683, when they laid siege to Vienna. Emperor Leopold of Austria fled and begged for assistance and help from John Sobieski, a great Polish general, who gathered his army and hastened to the rescue, stopping at one of Our Lady's shrines in Poland for blessing.</p><p>On September 11, Sobieski was on the heights of Kahlenberg, near Vienna, and the next day engaged in battle with the Turks. Brilliantly leading his troops, he forced the Turks into a trap, but the number of the foe was so great that he could not penetrate their ranks; then Sobieski's cavalry turned in retreat, interpreted by the Turks as flight. The Turks rushed forward; but were re-attacked. The shouts and cries of Sobieski's men threw terror into the Turks, when they learned that Sobieski himself, \"The Northern Lion,\" was on the battlefield, for he had defeated the Turks in Poland on previous occasions, and they feared him; therefore, the Turks fled panic-stricken. The battle raged for a time; all along the front was Sobieski everywhere commanding, fighting, encouraging his men and urging them forward. The Turks were finally defeated, Vienna and Christendom saved, and the news was sent to Pope Innocent XI at Rome. </p><p>Sobieski was a humble man, for in the height of his greatest victory, in a letter to Pope Innocent XI, he said it was God's cause he was fighting for, and Mary's honor. His message to the Pope on the victory read: \"I came, I saw, but God and Mary conquered.\"</p><p>The day after the Battle, Sobieski entered Vienna victoriously. Later he pursued the Turks into Hungary, again attacking them and defeating them. The Turkish threat to Europe had vanished forever. Pope Innocent XI after the battle of Vienna requested the whole Christian world to recite the Angelus for peace.The Angelus takes on special significance today because Communism has duplicated, in many respects, the pattern of the Turkish invasion of Europe.</p><p>The 500th anniversary of the institution of the Angelus by Pope Callistus III, was a reminder to recite the centuries old prayer for peace and for the protection of the Christian world from the Red menace of Communism..</p>"

The tree itself is believed to date from the time of the Druids, and crested one of the hills in the diocese of Malines. Soon the faithful began to come in crowds from throughout the region, for there were miraculous healings and various miracles granted to the pilgrims who invoked Mary under the name of Our Lady of the Oak.</p><p>In the year 1602 a small wooden chapel was built on the hill of Montaigu. The oak upon which the statue of Our Lady had once been displayed was now cut up into small pieces and carved by a local craftsman into statuettes of the same image.

It was in the chapel of this tiny village of Saint-Sulpice-le-Dunois, in the year 1631, that our story takes place involving Our Lady D Iron. </p><p>There was a young French couple living in the village at that time who felt themselves singularly blessed. Were they not fortunate? They took pleasure in their youth and enjoyed good health, had gainful employment, owned a modest home, and they had recently been blessed with a fine baby whom they felt was as sweet as the Babe of Bethlehem. Thus they mused on their way home together after early morning Mass one day.</p><p>As soon as they entered their home, Pierre hurried to the cradle to gaze lovingly at his infant son. The child must have been restless, he thought, as there was evidence that he had struggled with the bedclothes which were tossed about and tangled strangely about the infant. Pierre reached in and lifted his son to hold him in his arms, only to find that the tiny figure was rigid and cold. Stunned, he called for his wife disbelieving, for it seemed their baby was dead!</p><p>Pierre's thoughts turned to Our Blessed Mother, and then to the statue of Our Lady D Iron at the parish church. They had spent many hours there in the past praying for her assistance, and her help had never failed them. They determined to take their baby there instantly! Surely, Mary would not fail them in this time of dire need.</p><p>Together they entered the church, and sadly laid the lifeless form at the feet of the statue of Our Lady D Iron. As they began to pray for her intercession, they dedicated their baby to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In that very instant, the child who had been smothered by struggling in its cradle, cried out and came back to life. News of the miracle spread far and wide, and the fame of Our Lady D'Iron was assured.</p>"

At that time the Puglie region of Italy was suffering from a severe drought. For almost three years not a drop of rain had fallen. By the spring of 1641, matters were desperate. April had arrived and the heat was as in mid-summer. Thus prospects for relief and a good harvest that year appeared dim.</p><p>Then the people of Cursi and vicinity prayed fervently to the Blessed Mother, begging her to come to their aid and save them from the famine that drew ever nearer.</p><p>The Blessed Virgin heard their plea. She appeared to a shepherd, Baglio Orlando Natali. Thoroughly frightened by the appearance of the lovely lady, he ran away.</p><p>The Mother of God called him back, reassured him gently, and told him who she was. The Queen of Heaven said that she felt compassion toward Baglio and the people of that region for the misfortune that had befallen them.</p><p>The Blessed Virgin told Baglio to go to the pastor of the parish, and tell him in her name to assemble all the people of Cursi and come back with them to that very place where she wished a Church to be erected. When it was completed she would take Cursi and the surrounding section under her protection. As a token of her deep regard, she promised Baglio that at the end of that same year there would be a harvest of such abundance as none had ever seen before. Finally, she told Baglio that he was to change his way of life, for she had selected him to be her true follower, and that he was to serve in the new Church when it would be completed. So saying she vanished as suddenly as she had appeared.</p><p>Baglio lost no time in telling the pastor of this strange happening. The good Father gathered together the people, and led by Baglio, they all marched to the spot where the Virgin had appeared. There they fell to their knees and with one voice raised their hearts in prayers of praise and love to the Most Holy Virgin.</p><p>After some little time they reassembled and started on the return march to town. They had gone but a short distance, when a little cloud drifted into sight  -  then another, until the entire sky was overcast. Rain fell and drenched the whole crowd; but not one minded  -  in fact, all were so happy, that they laughed and shouted and played around in the downpour. It rained for three days.</p><p>The news of this happening quickly spread and great crowds hurried to the place of the apparition to offer their thanks to the Madonna. When the time of the harvest arrived, the crops in that area were so abundant that every barn was filled to overflowing.</p><p>Soon the grateful people erected a Church in honor of Holy Mary of Abundance or of Prosperity. Baglio, his old life behind him, donned the garb of a hermit and vowed to spend the rest of his life in prayer and in looking after the new shrine.</p><p>Some years later this Church was destroyed by fire resulting from a lightning stroke; but the people, recalling the goodness of the Virgin, immediately set to work and built the Present beautiful sanctuary. On the high altar there is a Greco-Byzantine fresco of the Madonna of Abundance or Prosperity  -  it depicts the Virgin with the Divine Infant. In their hands both hold sprigs of olives and ears of corn.</p>"

In the year 580, a certain Captain Mauricio, was deflected from his course by the winds and landed near present day Rossano. The hermit Ephrem went to meet him with the strange sounding greeting of:</p><p>\"It was not the winds that brought you here, but Our Lady, for once you are appointed emperor, you will build a church here.\"</p><p>A mere two year later, in the year 582, Mauritius was crowned emperor, and remembering the prophesy, had artists brought to the cave to paint a fitting image of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Although the artists toiled all day, during the night their work always mysteriously disappeared. The governor, unsure of what was happening, ordered that the cave be guarded at night.</p><p>That night as the guards went about their duty in front of the cave, a young woman of rare beauty came out of nowhere amidst a bright light wearing a white silk cape. She asked the guard to depart from the site, which they did. Informed the next morning of what had happened, the governor went to the church. To everyone's surprise he observed an image that perplexed him, for painted on the bottom of the inner wall was a beautiful picture of Our Lady, similar to the Byzantine icons he had seen before. It was exactly where his artists had been trying in vain to draw the image.</p><p>The news of the miracle soon spread throughout the city. The faithful began arriving to the place, shouting in wonder and cheering in tears with songs of praise, \"Acheropita! Acheropita!\"</p><p>The image became an object of veneration for the people of Rossano, and a new church had to be built to satisfy popular piety in a more worthy manner. That church is now known as the Rossano Cathedral, and it was built next to the grotto where the image is still preserved. It is also said that later the Saracens attacked, trying to surprise the city of Rossano, but they were repulsed by Our Lady, who appeared dressed in purple, and holding in her hand a lighted torch. The sight of her majesty terrified the Saracens, who turned and fled.</p><p>On May 26, 1949, the diocesan cathedral was erected at the shrine. From August 16 to October 16, 1949, a silver statue of Our Lady was carried on a triumphal pilgrimage through the archdiocese. August 15th is the annual date for the celebration of the Madonna Acheropita, and it is said that during the celebration a wonderful atmosphere envelops the whole of the city for the occasion, with the festival offering an opportunity for the faithful to demonstrate their love for the Blessed Virgin.</p>"

This was once the land of Saint Augustine, and remained Christian until the Arab invasions in later centuries. The French re-established themselves early in the 19th century.</p><p>There was, of course, no church in Algiers when the first bishop arrived, and the local population was hostile to the French. As he had no money to build a church, Bishop Dupuch went back to France to appeal for any assistance. The Sodality of Our Lady in Lyon had a bronze statue of the Immaculate Conception that they offered to the bishop with the understanding that she would be the Protectress of both the Mohammedans and the natives. It was brought from France in 1840 and was for long entrusted to the Cistercian monks of Staueli; then Cardinal Lavigiers, founder of the White Sisters, enshrined it in the new basilica at Algiers, where in 1876 the image was crowned.</p><p>The Basilica of Our Lady of Africa, or Notre Dame d'Afrique, was eventually built, and is situated on a height overlooking the Bay of Algiers. It took fourteen years to construct in an attractive Neo-Byzantine style, and was consecrated in the year 1872.</p><p>The statue donated by the sodality became known as Our Lady of Africa, and the statue venerated in Algiers today is this same bronze image, very dark in color, but with European features. Pilgrims began to come to venerate the image where the lame, the blind, and the crippled were miraculously healed, and sailors came also to beg for protection of their long and perilous voyages. The walls of the basilica are now covered with votive offerings testifying to the assistance the faithful had received from the Mother of Mercy.</p><p>At this and other North African shrines the veneration given to Mary by Mohammedans is very marked. The full name of Cardinal Lavigiers' congregation of White Sisters is Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa. There is an indulgenced prayer to Mary under that title for the conversion of the Africans on the apse: Notre Dame d'Afrique priez pour nous et pour les Musulmans (Our Lady of Africa, pray for us and for the Muslims.)

It was a place famous for its springs during the Roman era, and later the location of the royal court during the time of the Merovingians. Most importantly, however, this was the town of Charlemagne (768-814), and it remained the capital of the Holy Roman Empire until the middle of the sixteenth century. Thirty-seven German Emperors were crowned in Aschen. It was made the capital by Charlemagne and a great part of its lasting fame dates from his reign.</p><p>One of the first desires and orders of Charlemagne was to build a Lady Chapel because of his deep devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Our Lady of Aix la Chapelle, built by Charlemagne in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was consecrated by Leo II in the year 804. This was the same year the Saxons submitted to the emperor, and there were assembled three hundred and fifty prelates for the consecration ceremony.</p><p>The antique bronze doors of Our Lady of Aix la Chapelle are surmounted by regal lion heads, and they date from the time of Charlemagne. The short pillars of what is called the nave support an octagon shaped cupola of 50 feet in diameter. They date from the 12th and 13th centuries, and were brought from Rome for that purpose. These pillars were intentionally damaged by the atheistic proponents of the French Revolution, though they were thankfully restored in the year 1845.</p><p>The elegant Choir of Our Lady of Aix la Chapelle is filled with marvelous stained glass windows. This was a later addition to the church, completed in 1413, and is done in a completely separate style. One of the chapels of the cathedral has immeasurable treasures for the Christian world, as Charlemagne took pride in securing for the cathedral as many important relics from the Holy Land and Rome as he could. This pious practice was continued by his successors and it explains why the cathedral is so treasured by the Christian world.</p><p>In fact, the church of Our Lady of Aix la Chapelle holds innumerable precious offerings, including the four so-called great relics that are locked in a shrine that was given to the church by Frederick Barbarossa in the 12th century. These relics are the cloak of the Blessed Virgin, the swaddling clothes of the Infant Jesus, the loin cloth worn by Our Lord on the Cross, and the cloth on which lay the head of Saint John the Baptist following his beheading. These are exhibited only once in every seven years, and attract vast crowds of pilgrims.</p><p>Among the numerous smaller relics are a part of the true Cross, the cord which bound Our Lord, the sponge that was used to offer Our Lord gall during the crucifixion, and the girdle of both Christ and the Blessed Virgin. All are preserved in richly ornamented chests. Other treasures exhibited include the skull, heart, and gigantic arm bones of Charlemagne, and the cross he wore around his neck in the tomb. Judging by his bones, Charlemagne was a man of astonishing size, which was matched by his equally amazing intellect.</p><p>The tomb was opened in the year 1000 by Otho III, and the body of the great emperor was found seated upon a magnificent marble throne and wearing a golden crown. Only the nose of the great Charlemagne showed any sign of decay. The imperial mantle was thrown over his broad shoulders, and he held a globe in one hand, a splendid scepter in the other, and there was a sword at his side. This throne was later taken by Barbarossa in the year 1166, as he coveted the throne for his own coronation. It was subsequently used for the coronation of thirty-six emperors in that same church.</p><p>The last time the four great relics were displayed was the year 2007.</p>"

Bathed in a brilliant light, the statue became alive and spoke with a voice of indescribable beauty. Her Guardian Angel also appeared and taught her to pray.</p><p>The wooden statue, about 3 feet high, had been carved by an artist on the request of the Sisters of the Institute of the Handmaids of the Eucharist, founded by the local Bishop, Most Rev. John Shojiro Ito, of the Diocese of Niigata. This statue, from which the voice came, wept 101 times over a course of several years, from January 4, 1975, to September 15, 1981, the Feast of Our Lady of Seven Sorrows. It also perspired abundantly, and the perspiration sent out a sweet perfume. Its right palm bled from a wound that had the form of a cross.</p><p>Hundreds of people witnessed many of these events. Scientific analysis of blood and tears from the statue, provided by Professor Sagisaka of the faculty of Legal Medicine of the University of Akita, confirmed that the blood, tears, and perspiration were real human tears, sweat, and blood. They came from three blood groups: O, B, and AB.</p><p>Sister Agnes also has the stigmata on the right palm. A Korean woman with terminal brain cancer received immediate healing while praying before the statute in 1981. The miracle was confirmed by Dr. Tong-Woo-Kim of the St. Paul Hospital in Seoul and Fr. Theisen, President of the Ecclesiastical Tribunal of the Archdiocese of Seoul. The second miracle was the complete cure of the total deafness of Sister Agnes.</p><p><strong>Miraculous events</strong></p><p>The events began on June 12-14, 1973. During these days, Sister Agnes saw a brilliant light coming from the tabernacle. On Thursday, June 28, eve of the Feast of the Sacred Heart, Sister Agnes again saw a blinding light from the Blessed Sacrament, rays of light, and a multitude of angels surrounding the altar in adoration before the Host.</p><p>In the evening, another mysterious event occurred. While praying in the chapel, Sister Agnes felt as though something pierced the palm of her left hand. There, in the center of her palm, were two red scratches in the form of a cross. As days went by, the pain became increasingly intense.</p><p>This phenomenon recurs every week, and Bishop Ito himself witnesses it: on Thursday evening, the wound is still dried out, but it begins to swell up, and scratches form on the skin. On Friday morning, blood flows and impregnates the bandages of gauze. On Saturday morning, the wound stops bleeding and becomes dry again. This phenomenon lasted the whole month of July.</p><p>On July 6, the Guardian Angel appeared to Sister Agnes, and said: \"Do not fear. I am the one who is with you and watches over you. Do not fear. Pray with fervor not only because of your sins, but in reparation for those of all men. The world today wounds the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord by its ingratitudes and injuries. The wounds of Mary are much deeper and sorrowful than yours. Let us go and pray together in the chapel.\"</p><p><strong>Messages of Mary</strong></p><p>In the chapel, the statue of the Virgin Mary came to life, and a voice of indescribable beauty struck her totally-deaf ears. This was to be the first Message of Mary:</p><p>\"My daughter, My novice, you have obeyed Me well in abandoning all to follow Me. Is the infirmity of your ears painful? Your deafness will be healed, be sure. Be patient. It is the last trial. Does the wound of your hand cause you to suffer? Pray in reparation for the sins of men. Each person in this community is My irreplaceable daughter. Do you say well the prayer of the Handmaids of the Eucharist? Then, let us pray it together:</p><p>\"Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, truly present in the Holy Eucharist, I consecrate my body and soul to be entirely one with Your Heart, being sacrificed at every instant on all the altars of the world and giving praise to the Father, pleading for the coming of His Kingdom. Please receive this humble offering of myself. Use me as You will for the glory of the Father and the salvation of souls.</p><p>\"Most Holy Mother of God. Never let me be separated from Your Divine Son. Please defend and protect me as Your special child. Amen.\"</p><p>As her Guardian Angel had told her, a cross-shaped wound, similar to that of Sister Agnes, appeared in the right hand of the statue of the Blessed Virgin, and blood started to flow.</p><p>On August 3, 1973, the First Friday of the month, Sister Agnes received the second Message from Mary:</p><p>\"My daughter, My novice, do you love the Lord? If you love the Lord, listen to what I have to say to you. It is very important. You will convey it to your superior.</p><p>\"Many men in this world afflict the Lord. I desire souls to console Him to soften the anger of the Heavenly Father. I wish, with My Son, for souls who will repair, by their suffering and their poverty, for the sinners and ingrates.</p><p>\"In order that the world might know His anger, the Heavenly Father is preparing to inflict a great chastisement on all mankind. With My Son, I have intervened so many times to appease the wrath of the Father. I have prevented the coming of calamities by offering Him the sufferings of the Son on the Cross, His Precious Blood, and beloved souls who console Him and form a cohort of victim souls.</p><p>\"Prayer, penance, and courageous sacrifices can soften the Father's anger. I desire this also from your community, that it love poverty, that it sanctify itself and pray in reparation for the ingratitude and outrages of so many men. Recite the prayer of the Handmaids of the Eucharist with awareness of its meaning; put it into practice: offer (whatever God may send) in reparation for sins. Let each one endeavour, according to her capacity and position, to offer herself entirely to the Lord.</p><p>\"Even in a secular institute, prayer is necessary. Already souls who wish to pray are on the way to being gathered. Without attaching too much attention to the form, be faithful and fervent in prayer to console the Master.\"</p><p>It was on Saturday, October 13, the anniversary day of the last Apparition of the Virgin Mary to the three children of Fatima, that Mary gave to Sister Agnes Her third Message, the most important and serious one:</p><p>\"If men do not repent and better themselves, the Father will inflict a terrible punishment on all humanity. It will be a punishment greater than the deluge, such as one will never have seen before. Fire will fall from the sky and will wipe out a great part of humanity, the good as well as the bad, sparing neither priests nor faithful. The survivors will find themselves so desolate that they will envy the dead. The only arms which will remain for you will be the Rosary and the Sign left by My Son. Each day recite the prayers of the Rosary. With the Rosary, pray for the Pope, the Bishops and the priests.</p><p>\"The work of the devil will infiltrate even into the Church in such a way that one will see Cardinals opposing Cardinals, Bishops against other Bishops. The priests who venerate Me will be scorned and opposed by their confreres (other priests). Churches and altars will be sacked. The Church will be full of those who accept compromises, and the demon will press many priests and consecrated souls to leave the service of the Lord.</p><p>\"The demon will be especially implacable against the souls consecrated to God. The thought of the loss of so many souls is the cause of My sadness. If sins increase in number and gravity, there will no longer be pardon for them.</p><p>\"...Pray very much the prayers of the Rosary. I alone am able to still save you from the calamities which approach. Those who place their confidence in Me will be saved.\"</p><p>The last Sunday of May, 1982, during the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, Sister Agnes was completely cured from her deafness.</p>"

The sister the statue named was not one of the patients, but was actually the nurse who cared for them. The lay sister thought the nurse had seemed perfectly well a short time before, and saw no particular reason to think that she was in any danger of dying.

The choir is flanked by seven chapels, that in the center being the \"Lady Chapel.\" This shrine to Mary is so beautiful that one poet aptly wrote, \"It is not possible to add anything to or to take anything from it.\"</p><p>Still, it should be noted that the cathedral might have completely collapsed in the 16th century were it not for Pierre Tarisel, who observed that the entire structure was unstable, as the flying buttresses were insufficient for the task of upholding the nave. He designed a system for supporting the walls which is still in place today. The cathedral was intentionally targeted for destruction by bombing during World War II, although the bombs missed the cathedral through a seeming miracle.</p>"

        "eng": "<p>Our Lady of Angels, or of the Portiuncula, is located six hundred yards from the city of Assissium, in Italy. It was a desolate locality, and apparently an unsettled one where robbers and the lawlessness flourished, for the Benedictines who had lived at the monastery felt it was too hazardous to remain there. They abandoned the monastery, relocating to Mount Subasio, which was a fortified monastery.</p><p>The original chapel is thought to date from the 4th Century, and was built by holy hermits who had come from the Valley of Josaphat. It is said that they brought relics of the Blessed Virgin with them to the region when they constructed the chapel.</p><p>When Saint Francis chanced to come upon the little, run down and abandoned chapel of Our Lady of Angels, or Santa Maria degli Angelis, in the year 1208, it was almost completely hidden in shrubs and brush. Saint Francis entered the hidden church, which measured only twenty-two feet by thirteen feet, and saw the ancient fresco that had been placed above the main altar. It was an image of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin surrounded by angels. Some say that this is why the chapel was named Our Lady of Angels, although there are also legends that angels could often be heard singing there.</p><p>The place took its name, the Little Portion, or Portiuncula in the native Italian, from the small section of fertile land that was gifted to the monks for them to work for their support. It is said that this was the place where Saint Francis first understood his vocation, received visions, and was also where the saint desired to live. The Benedictines had lived at that location for hundreds of years, but the Benedictine monks gave this chapel to Saint Francis upon his request. It was certainly here that the Franciscan Order was founded.</p><p>At first Saint Francis wished the convent which he built there to be the principal one of his order. He assembled the first General Chapter there, where there were five thousand religious. It was also where he yielded up the ghost on October 3rd in the year 1226, the twentieth of his conversion, and the forty-fifth of his age. The cell in which the poor man of Assisi died can still be seen where it rests against one of the columns of the cupola under the choir bay.</p>"

They prayed earnestly to God and Our Lady, and, after a day and a night, angels came in visible form and released them.</p><p>The men discovered a spring near the place where they had been bound, which they considered to be miraculous. They determined to set up a shrine of Our Lady on the spot in thanksgiving for their deliverance.</p><p>The first statue they put into the shrine was only intended to be temporary, to be used until something better could be made or purchased. However, almost immediately there began a stream of miraculous cures among those who prayed before the rough little statue. In the years that followed, fervent pilgrims came in droves to the shrine, as evidenced by the numerous drinking vessels found during archaeological excavations carried out on the site.</p><p>The same statue remains today, but it has been richly clothed and decked with jewels. In 1260 the little chapel was enlarged to enclose also the spring. In 1663 the chapel was rebuilt and redecorated, and so remained until the French Revolution, when it was completely destroyed. However, after the Terror had passed, the chapel was rebuilt in 1808.</p><p>One of the many thank-offerings in the chapel is a ship suspended above the altar, as an ex-voto from a group of sailors who were saved from shipwreck at the intercession of Our Lady.</p><p>On Sunday, September 9, 2012, the Diocese of Saint-Denis celebrated the 800th anniversary of the pilgrimage to Notre-Dame-des-Anges in Clichy-sour-Bois, under the leadership of Bishop Pascal Delannoy.

Alves threw out his net and slowly pulled it in. There was something in it  -  not a fish, but something that looked like a chunk of wood. When he lifted it from the net, it turned out to be a headless statue of the Blessed Virgin.</p><p>The fisherman cast his net into the water again. When he pulled it into his boat, he found that this time it held a roundish piece of wood  -  the head from the very same statue. He picked up both pieces and found that they fitted perfectly together.</p><p>Obeying an impulse, Alves lowered his net one more time. When Alves began to pull the net back in, he found he could hardly lift the net because it was bulging with fish. His companions threw out their nets and they had the same luck. A few more casts and their boats were filled with fish.</p><p>The next day they fastened the head to the body of the statue, cleaned it, and one of them set it up in his humble dwelling. The story of the statue and the immense catch of fish spread and every evening people came to pay homage to the Blessed Virgin. They gave it the name Aparecida, \"She who appeared.\" Soon a little chapel was erected  -  the crowds were too big for the humble cottage; then a larger chapel was built. Our Lady well repaid those who honored her, for numerous cures and even extraordinary miracles took place at her shrine.</p><p>In 1846, work began on the construction of a new church, completed in 1888, and the statue was transferred to it. In 1904 by order of the Holy Father, the image was solemnly crowned. In 1909 the church was raised to the level of a minor basilica; in 1930 Pope Pius XI promoted it to a Basilica and officially declared Our Lady of Aparecida the Patroness of Brazil.</p><p>Our Lady of Aparecida has been specifically targeted on several occasions by the Protestants in Brazil, as on May 16, 1978, a Protestant attempted to steal the statue, taking it from its niche and casting it on the ground when he was stopped by guards and parishioners.

The approved apparitions of Our Lady in 1449 that occurred there are now almost inexplicably unknown, barely mentioned in passing, or treated as a legend in some books if even recognized as a point on some ancient map. It is true that the hosts of Napoleon looted and destroyed the sanctuary and monastery built there, and that the war in 1936 did not leave one stone upon another, but the memory of what happened there in 1449 must not be forgotten, at least by Catholics.</p><p>In the year 1449, Cubas was only a village with a simple church dedicated to Saint Andrew. The population of Cubas, however, lived quite forgetful of their duties to God, and their sins were so many that it seemed even to them that the hand of God must be hovering over the land, ready to punish them.</p><p>The Chronicles speak then of a young girl of 12 named Ines, (sometimes Yves or Agnes) who was but of humble birth. Still, there was something about her that made her different from other girls her age. She fasted, confessed regularly, and prayed daily the 15 mysteries of the Rosary. Perhaps her deep faith and religiosity may explain what happened next.</p><p>On Monday, March 3rd, 1449, Ines was tending pigs on the outskirts of town in a place called Cecilia, when at noon a woman appeared, a lady bright and beautiful dressed in cloth of gold. She was surrounded by light, and asked Ines what she was doing there. Ines stated that she was tending the pigs. The Lady then said that the people were no longer keeping the fasts, and told Ines the necessity of fasting. The lady said that the people of Cubas must change their ways, confess, and cease their debauchery and offenses against God, or He would soon punish them. There would be a great pestilence that would come upon them from which many would die. Perhaps knowing the hardheartedness of the people, Ines asked if she, too, or her mother and father, would die of this pestilence. She was told only that it would be as God desired. The lady then disappeared.</p><p>At first Ines did not tell anyone of the incident, for she thought no one would believe what had happened.</p><p>On Tuesday, March 4th, Ines was again tending the pigs, this time near the stream of Torrejon. At about the same time of day, at noon, just as the day before, the Lady reappeared. She asked Ines if she had told the people what she had been told to say, but Ines answered that she dared not to, for she suspected that she would not be believed. The Lady then commanded Ines to warn the people, and that if they did not believe, she would give her a sign. Ines asked the Lady who she was, but she said she would not tell yet before once again disappearing. Finally Ines decided to tell her father, Alfonso Martinez, who did not give any importance to the events recounted by his daughter, but thought it a children's story, a story invented in the imagination of a young girl. He told Ines to be quiet when she tried to tell anyone about the warning.</p><p>On Friday, March 7th, Ines was keeping the pigs in New Prado, when the Lady reappeared again as before. She asked Ines if she had told what she had been commanded to say. Ines answered that she had told her mother and father, and many others. The Lady told Ines to publish what she had said to all the people without any fear or trepidation.</p><p>When Ines went home at the end of the day she told her parents what had happened. Her father told her she was lying and to \"shut up,\" but her mother encouraged Ines, saying, \"Well, still, say it.\"</p><p>By Sunday, March 9th, word had spread. A priest, Juan Gonzalez, with some other men, when to Ines' home and talked to her parents. Afterwards, the priest went to say Mass. Ines went out with the pigs, accompanied by her brother John, to a place called The Ciroleda. Ines' father left them and went to Mass. The Ciroleda was a watery meadow that the pigs liked. Ines left her brother after a time looking for one of the pigs that had slipped away, and soon lost sight of her brother. All by herself, she knelt on the soft earth, asking the lady to return, even though she was afraid.</p><p>The Lady appeared again as before, telling Ines to rise. \"Lady, who are you?\" Ines asked. \"I am the Virgin Mary,\" the lady answered, and approaching Ines, took her right hand and squeezed her fingers and thumb together, making some kind of a sign. She then told Ines to go to the church and show the sign to the people as they left Mass. Ines told her brother to watch after the pigs, and went to the church, arriving just as Mass was letting out. She was crying, and went to kneel before the altar of Mary. There, she told everyone what had happened.</p><p>I cannot decipher what the sign was in Ines' hand, but whatever it was, the people examined her hand and many believed. The following day the priest led the notables of the town and the faithful in a procession to the place of the last apparitions, carrying a wooden cross. When they arrived, Ines walked forward alone with the cross. The Virgin Mary herself took the cross, telling Ines to have a church built there in her honor.</p><p>The cross was permanently placed where the Virgin, Our Lady of Apparitions, had been last seen, and many miracles occurred there, including 11 people who were brought back to life. A church was begun shortly after the apparitions of the Virgin were approved. It stood for nearly five centuries, when it was destroyed in the 1936 fire, caused during the Civil War. Many of the nuns were martyred. In 1949 the reconstruction was completed in part by the Regiones Devastadas, who placed the current cross in the same place where the first had been.</p><p>According to tradition, Ines ended her life in the monastery of Santa Maria de la Cruz after having children and being widowed. It is said that anyone who goes to visit the place, with faith, receives special graces, and that miracles still occur there.</p>"

The ship was in great danger and the merchant, being a pious Catholic, knelt before a picture of Our Lady which he always kept on board his ship.</p><p>Soon after he began praying a bright light was seen shining through the darkness and the ship came to rest in calm waters. When daylight came, it could be seen that the vessel was safely anchored at the foot of a very steep wooded mountain.</p><p>Hildebrand went back below decks to kneel before the illustration of Our Lady in thanksgiving, when he found that the picture was no longer there.

Greatly moved, the merchant finished his business as soon as possible in England and returned to Portugal.

The Evil of Ardent, the disease caused a kind of gangrene in the limbs, and the strange sickness caused terrible suffering in all parts of the body, and laid low both men and women, and even their children throughout the whole of the region.</p><p>There were at that time two minstrels, one named Itier, who lived in Brabant, and the other named Norman, who lived in the Chateau de Saint-Pol. They had vowed a mortal hatred, as Norman had killed Itier's brother.</p><p>One night they both had the same dream: the Virgin Mary, dressed in white, appeared to them and told them to go to the cathedral. Norman, who was closer, arrived first. As he entered the cathedral he saw all the patients who had taken refuge there. He found the bishop and told him of the apparition, but Bishop Lambert thought that Norman was mocking him and sent him away. Itier arrived the following day and also spoke to the bishop. When the bishop told Itier that someone named Norman had come to tell him of the same vision, Itier asked where he was, because he intended to kill him on the field to avenge his brother's death. Bishop Lambert then understood that the Blessed Virgin had sent the two men to be reconciled. The bishop spoke to each separately and then put them in each other's presence and asked them to give each other the kiss of peace and then spend the night in prayer inside the cathedral.</p><p>It was Pentecost Sunday, May 28, 1105, at about three o'clock in the morning, when the Virgin Mary appeared to the two minstrels in the Cathedral. Norman and Itier witnessed a sudden light as the Blessed Virgin descended from the height of the nave, carrying a lighted candle in her hands. She gave the men the candle intended for the healing of the sick, and explained to them what they must do. A few drops of the wax that fell from the candle were to be mingled with water, giving it miraculous properties the people would then drink.</p><p>All who believed were healed. The two minstrels, now brothers, distributed the miraculous water and the epidemic was stopped, for the patients would regain their health after they drank of the water mixture. There were many prodigies of healing that went on for hundreds of years, especially with wounds, inflammations, and ulcers. All of this shows how reconciliation and prayer are pleasing to God and can precipitate great miracles, such as curing diseases, ending natural disasters, as well as ending or preventing wars.</p><p>The Bishop of Arras wanted to build a church worthy of Our Lady of Ardents and to receive the relic of the Holy Candle, and the church was consecrated in 1876 just before the definitive establishment of the Third Republic.</p><p>This relic, the Holy Candle, can still be seen today.

The dark brown fabric is typical of the clothing in the early centuries of the Christian era. The fabric was dyed brown, using a method widely in practice at the time by people of modest means. The construction and dyeing show the tunic to date from the time of Christ. It is the garment worn by Christ after the Flagellation and along the road to Calvary as He carried His cross. Christ's blood and sweat thus impregnate the fabric. In 1985 a test was done showing the blood was type AB. Pollen common to Palestine have also been found in the fabric.</p>"

He sent word to Mariette to forget about it and not spread stories.</p><p>The next morning, Wednesday, the priest was surprised to see Mariette at Holy Mass  -  she had quit school because she failed in her First Holy Communion examination three times, and after that had not gone to church anymore. That day Marietta went to school and for the first time in her life knew her lessons well.</p><p>The next evening she went into the garden, knelt and said the rosary; her father followed her with a coat which he threw around her shoulders. He tried to get the pastor who was out, then called a neighbor, a practicing Catholic, and together they followed. The child was being beckoned on to the highway by the lady, now known as Our Lady of Banneux, till they reached a spring, into which Marietta plunged her hands at the command of the lady, who said, \"This spring is set aside for me. Good night!\" Then she vanished.</p><p>When they reached home, the Abbe was waiting for them. Marietta described the lady: \"Her robe was long and white; she wore a blue belt and rays of light shone from her head. She was a little more than five feet tall; her right foot was bare and under it a golden rose. Her hands were raised to her breast on which was a golden heart. A rosary hung from her right arm: - all similar to the Lourdes apparition.</p><p>There were six or seven more apparitions of Our Lady of Banneux; at one of these Marietta, at the advice of the pastor asked the lady her name, to which Our Lady of Banneux replied, \"I am the Virgin of the poor,\" and leading the girl to a spring, said, \"This spring is for all nations\u2026for the sick\u2026I would like a chapel built. I come to relieve suffering. Have faith in me and pray much. My dear child, pray hard\u2026\" At the end of each visit Mary would say \"Au revoir,\" which means, \"until we meet,\" but at the last visit she said, \"Adieu,\" which means, \"good-bye.\" She blessed Marietta then, at which the girl fainted. Marietta did not see the lady depart.</p><p>The Beco family and many others became model Catholics. The chapel was built, and the spring became the site of numberless cures. During the German occupation of Belgium in 1942, the bishop encouraged the cult of Our Lady of Banneux, Our Lady of the Poor.</p><p>In 1947, the bishop approved the devotion. In 1948 the cornerstone of a new basilica was laid; this was to supplant the small chapel. During the war, Marietta married a Dutch salesman. During the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, an American chaplain found them and their fifteen month old baby living in a cellar of a small home occupied by American troops.</p><p>Belgium is one more reminder in these days when communism seems to be sweeping everything before it, that our great hope  -  our only hope  -  lies in our carrying out the requests Our Lady made at Fatima and other places. Mary prays for us without ceasing, but we, too, must pray, must sacrifice. We must do our part, if we expect Mary to help us.</p>"

A young boy had drowned, and his mother, full of faith, brought his body to lay at the feet of the image of the Mother of God, seeking a miracle.

From that time on, the chapel became a popular place of pilgrimage.</p><p>A Benedictine monastery was founded there in 1330 by the Emperor Ludwig IV, who established a community of twelve knights with their families to guard the place. However, it is the Capuchin friars who have served the shrine now for centuries, among them Brother Conrad of Parzham, who acted as porter for over forty years.</p><p>The emperor Ludwig gave a small statue of the Mother of God, carved in Italy; and the place was soon famous both for its shrine of Mary and the learning of the monks. In 1744 the medieval church was burnt down, its successor being built and decorated in the German baroque manner. The chapel has an unusual octagonal shape, and it is thought to be the oldest Marian shrine in Germany.

It is thought that it might have been built for a monastery of Benedictine monks, but was subsequently sold to a man named Geoffrey de Bourlemont.</p><p>It is known that Joan of Arc liked to go to Our Lady of Bermont on pilgrimage on Saturdays when she was a little girl, and also often during the week, to offer candles and flowers to Our Lady.

The image has blue eyes and blonde hair, and since the drawing was made during the time of Joan's life, and Joan was known to pray at the church, the local bishop stated that he thought the portrait must certainly be of Joan of Arc. As it is little more than a line drawing, it really tells us little of what Joan may have looked like.</p><p>Nothing in twelfth-century art is so fine as the air and gesture of sympathetic majesty.

On December 29th the children related, the Blessed Virgin revealed on her breast a heart of gold. The next evening she asked for more prayers.

The river Gave, beside which the shrine is located, is the same river whose waters flow past Lourdes.</p><p>The shrine of Our Lady of Betharam is famous for no less than three miracles attributed to the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p><p>According to tradition, one day in 1503 there were some shepherds leading their flocks along the bank of the river Gave when they suddenly observed an extremely bright light coming from the rocks. When they drew nearer, they found a beautiful statue of the Blessed Virgin. Learning of the incident, the people in the nearby village of Lestelle decided to construct a chapel to house the statue. Due to space limitations, the chapel was initially planned for the opposite bank from where the statue had been found. Once the statue was placed there, however, they found that it would always return on its own to the other side of the river where it had originally been found. The faithful then understood that the Blessed Virgin desired that the chapel should be built where the statue had been found, and so it happened.</p><p>The next miracles occurred in the year 1616 when some peasants from the village of Montaut were returning home from the fields at the end of the day. A rushing storm suddenly appeared, with fierce winds that threatened Betharram. In fact, the laborers saw that there was a cyclone in the storm that beat against the great wooden cross that had been erected at the summit. The cross fell, but then was encircled by a radiant aura of dazzling light before standing again of its own to its former position.</p><p>The third miracle is the one after which the shrine is named. Apparently a young girl fell headfirst into the Gave when trying to pluck a flower along the bank. The water runs fast in deep in this area, and the girl was on the verge of drowning when she cried aloud to Our Lady of Betharam of the nearby shrine. The Blessed Virgin appeared standing on the bank holding the Divine Infant, who held a branch which he extended to rescue the girl. She offered a golden branch to the shrine as an ex-voto offering. A beautiful branch is \u2018Betharram' in the local dialect, and thus became the name of the shrine.</p><p>There were many other miracles, as at one point between the years 1620 and 1642 there were 82 documented miracles involving the blind who received their sight, the paralyzed who regained the use of the limbs, and those instantly cured of cancer, among other miracles.</p><p>Saint Bernadette Soubirous frequently visited the shrine of Betharram. In fact, the rosary beads that Bernadette used when praying with the Blessed Virgin during the first apparition at Lourdes had come from the Betharram shrine, and the priest that she was sent to after the apparitions was Saint Michel Garicois, the priest of Betharram. He it was who alone believed Bernadette's accounts of the apparitions at Lordes. He was canonized in 1947.</p><p>The cross on the summit that the winds could not destroy was finally destroyed by the folly of man during the French Revolution. The property was unlawfully confiscated and the chaplains expelled.</p><p>Saint Pope Pius X was known to be devoted to Our Lady of Betharam.

The lords and their men were all drawn up, and eager for the attack. Those who had reconnoitered the place said it could not hold out long. The Bretons, Burgundians, Normans, Germans, and others, who knew there was much wealth in the place, which, if taken by storm, would probably fall to their share, began to skirmish with the infantry at the barriers, without waiting for orders from the constable or marshals of the army.</p><p>This skirmish increased so much that the French set fire to the town by means of fire-arrows and cannons, so that such a flame and smoke came from the houses of Bourbourg as might have been seen forty leagues off. Many gallant deeds were done, and the assailants leaped cheerfully into the mud of the ditches above the knees when they engaged with the English at the palisade and barriers.</p><p>The garrison defended themselves handsomely: indeed they had need of their exertions, for they knew not on which side to turn themselves. They were attacked on all parts: and the houses of the town were blazing with fire, which more confounded the English than anything else. This, however, did not throw them off their guard, nor cause them to quit their posts. Sir Matthew Redman and Sir Nicholas Drayton, with their men, in the centre of the town, endeavored to check the progress of the fire; but it was such a dry season, that the smallest spark set the houses in flames. It is certain, that if the attack had begun earlier, or had not the night come on soon, the town must have been taken by storm, but the approach of night put an end to it.</p><p>On the attack ceasing, the French retired to their quarters, to attend the sick and bury the dead. They said that on the morrow they would renew the attack, and it should be irresistible. The English were employed in repairing the palisades which had been broken, in putting all things in a good state, and in extinguishing the fires in the town. They were in a most perilous situation, being surrounded on all sides, without means of escaping by flight.</p><p>The duke of Brittany, who was on the opposite side of the town to the king, entered into negotiations with the English, aware of the peril they were in. He advised them to surrender the town, on their lives and fortunes being spared. This they were very willing to do, and they entreated the duke, through love of God, and in honor of his gentility, to undertake the business. The king of France replied, that, in God's name, he would willingly agree to a treaty. The English had been much renowned for gallantry and deeds of arms, and it was settled that the English should depart from Bourbourg and Gravelines, and carry away with them as much of their wealth as they could. Several of the Bretons, French, Normans, and Burgundians were much vexed at this treaty, for they thought of partaking of the spoils; but the king and his council had ordered it otherwise.</p><p>The whole of Tuesday they employed in shoeing their horses, and in packing up all their wealth, of which they had much, and in making preparations for their departure. On the Wednesday morning they loaded their baggage-horses and began their march, passing through the army with passports from the king. The Bretons were much exasperated when they saw them so loaded, waiting at Calais for a favorable wind to return to England.</p><p>The king of France, and all the lords of his army, with their attendants, entered Bourbourg on Thursday morning.

In that church a pillager stood upon an altar with the intent of forcing out a precious stone that was in the crown of an image of Our Lady. As he reached to steal the stone, the image suddenly turned about, and the pillager in his fright fell from the altar and was instantly struck dead. This is a certain truth, for many persons were witnesses of it. Shortly afterwards, another pillager came with a similar intent of robbing the image; but all the bells began a peal without any one touching them, for no one could have rung them, the bell-ropes being drawn up and fastened.</p><p>On account of these miracles, the church was visited by large crowds. The king made a handsome present to the church, as did all the lords, so that the amount of their gifts was upwards of three thousand francs.\"</p>"

It fell uninjured with such violence that it broke into the pavement, and sunk more than 20 feet into the earth, whence it was never possible to draw it out.</p><p>There is a church currently in London named Saint Mary-le-Bow that was constructed in about 1080 by the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is a Norman church which may have replaced a previous structure of Saxon origin, and that building may have been destroyed in a storm in 1071.</p><p>What is certain is that there was a terrible storm in the city of London in the month of October in the year 1091, based on a 12th century chronicle. This may be the actual date referred to by the Abbot Orsini, as it was recorded that there was a great wind and a tornado from the south that killed two men and lifted the roof and rafters of the church so high that when they fell the rafters were driven so far into the earth that only a seventh or eighth part of them remained visible. The rafters were nearly 30 feet long. It is also mentioned that the rafters could not be pulled back out of the ground, and so were sawed off at ground level and left. I can find no mention of an image of Mary that also was driven into the ground at that time.</p><p>The church of Saint Mary-le-Bow takes its name from the unusual Norman arches, or bows, which were considered a novelty. The church is thought to be built above a crypt from a much earlier age. Sir Christopher Wren, who rebuilt the church after it was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666, felt it was of Roman origin, and wanted it used as a burial chamber. At that time the only access to the crypt was by a trapdoor with a ladder, although later a staircase was constructed to assist access.</p><p>Besides the tornado that struck the church in 1091, there was a fire in 1196. A tower of the church collapsed in 1271, and the church was completely destroyed by the German's in World War II before being rebuilt in 1964.</p><p>There is a saying that to be a true Londoner, a Cockney, one must be born within hearing distance of the bells of Saint Mary-Le-Bow.

The precious relic was brought from Palestine by Thierry of Alsace on his return from the second crusade. From 1150 this relic has been venerated with much devotion. The annual pilgrimage attended by the nobility in their quaint robes takes place on the Monday following the first Sunday in May. Not only the Flemish nobility take part, but also thousands of pilgrims from all over Christendom.</p><p>Every Friday the relic is less solemnly exposed for the veneration of the Faithful.

He built a shrine of wood that same year for the statue, and pilgrimages date from 1525 and took such a scale that in 1624 the Cardinal Francois de Sourdis authorized the construction of a stone chapel. This small chapel was gradually buried by the sands, and it was decided to build a new one which was completed in 1723. The church is known as the church of L'eglise Notre Dame des Passes, or Notre-Dame Arcachon. Many miracles have been wrought through devotion to Mary at the shrine, and the church is dedicated to sailors who face the channels for entry into the Arcachon basin.</p><p>There is a tall cross known as the Sailors Cross which stands at the end of the pier of the chapel.

His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye. Now there were set there six water-pots of stone, according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece. Jesus saith to them: Fill the water-pots with water.

A little later, some of the people chanced to bathe in the stream flowing from beneath the rock and were amazed of ind their aches and pains had mysteriously vanished.

        "eng": "<p>In the mountains outside Santiago in Cuba is an old pilgrimage church, \"Nuestra Senora de la Caridad,\" which means, \"Our Lady of Charity,\" also known as \"Our Lady of Cobre.\" It is the national shrine of Cuba.</p><p>Early in the 17th century, three sailors left the Bay of Nipe to collect salt. Their vessel was small, so that when a storm arose they were drifting and rocked violently on the roaring ocean. One of the men wore a medal stamped with an image of the Blessed Virgin, and the three began to pray for her protection. The storm suddenly cleared, and the men saw something they could not immediately identify coming toward across the water.</p><p>We still have the testimony of one of the men, Juan Moreno, regarding this incident. It was taken in 1687:</p><p>\"Having camped in the French Key, which is in the middle of the Bay of Nipe, waiting for a good time to leave for the salt mines, being a morning of calm seas, they left the French Keys, before daybreak. The aforementioned Juan y Rodrigo de Hoyos and myself embarked in a canoe, headed for the salt mines, and far from the French Key we saw something white above the foam of the water, which we couldn't distinguish. As we got closer, birds and dry branches appeared. The aforementioned Indians said, \"It looks like a girl.\" While they were discussing this among themselves, they saw an image of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin, on top of a small wooden plank, holding the baby Jesus in her arms. On this small tablet, was written in large letters, which read, \"I am the Virgin of Charity.\" Looking at her clothes, they realized that they were not wet.\"</p><p>Upon returning home, the men revealed what they had discovered and told the story of what had happened to them. A government official, Don Francisco Sanchez de Moya, had a small chapel built in her honor.</p><p>The Village of Cobre, where the shrine is, is surrounded by high hills that roll back to the Sierra Maestra Mountains. The village is named Cobre because of the rich deposit of copper. A lamp of copper is kept burning before the statue of Our Lady. Twice the statue mysteriously disappeared from the locked church, and then returned just as unaccountably. In each case Our Lady indicated where richer deposits of copper could be found.</p><p>In 1936 after the completion of a beautiful church in honor of Our Lady of Charity, the statue was solemnly crowned amid great rejoicing and religious festivity.</p><p>The shrine has much of old-time charm, and literally hundreds of lights burn before the shrine's statue. Our Lady is dressed richly in silken garments; she is dark like a Cuban girl with a sun-tanned Infant on her arm, smiling down on her brown Cuban children, who come to her in great numbers and with great confidence. The prayers of centuries seem to hang down from the walls in heavy folds. It is a place where prayer comes easily, and its answer seems to be a matter of course.</p>"

    "Our Lady of Chartres": {
        "eng": "<p>Our Lady of Chartres, or Notre-Dame de Chartres, is a beautiful Gothic style cathedral located in Beauce, France, which is about 50 miles southwest of Paris. This cathedral, which was first built in the time of the apostles, was demolished several times over the centuries. It was re-erected in its present state by Saint Fulbert, the fifty-fifth bishop of Chartres at the end of the 12th century into the beginning of the 13th century.</p><p>Our Lady of Chartres is the site of possibly the oldest existing devotion to Mary - tradition states that an ancient order of Celts paid homage, centuries before her birth to the mother of the prophesier Savior, the Virgin who was to bear a Son.</p><p>The story of the student's pilgrimage to Chartres started in 1935 with a group of fifteen young men and girls of the Sorbonne, who sacrificed their Pentecostal holidays in prayer to the Holy Spirit and to Mary. They marched to the shrine in the Chartres pilgrimage and prayed in common as did their predecessors. The next year there were 36 who went, and in the following year 150. Then the war came; but during the eight hard years that followed, the pilgrimages were not given up. The numbers increased, until in 1948 about 6,500 students formed their line of march to Mary.</p><p>Most of the pilgrims were in their early twenties or late teens, from the universities, colleges and schools of Paris and the provinces, although some were from foreign countries. The number of unbelievers, atheists and Communists has always been high even among the students; while Protestants and Jews also make up a goodly part of the pilgrims. Some come out of curiosity, some following the persistent urgings of a friend; some for the sport of hiking, or to answer an invitation to test their grit and endurance; but whatever their reasons for starting, few end without a definite spiritual \"lift.\" Many make the pilgrimage in bare feet over gravel roads, which is not easy; the sick and crippled go, too.</p><p>In making the Chartres pilgrimage, these young people help to give France a new birth of devotion to Mary; something new and spotless has been born as in the warmth of Bernadette, the Cure of Ars, Vincent de Paul - re-lighted in the hearts of young moderns. France must now place her hope in youth, the youth of France and the youth of the Church, through Our Blessed Mother, the Lady of Chartres.</p>"

It is actually pre-Christian, and in a case similar to the Athenians' \u2018altar to the unknown god,' was dedicated to the Virgin who would bring forth a son, at least a century before the birth of Christ.</p><p>The Cathedral of Notre Dame at Chartres is probably the most beautiful Gothic church in the world; but far predating the Christian cathedral, the location was famous for its crypt - and the shrine of Our Lady of the Underground. It is known that Chartres was long the site of the Druid's most important sanctuary, and where they worshiped an image that came to be known as Our Lady of Chartres. Indeed, Chartres was a kind of pilgrimage destination long before the construction of the beautiful Gothic cathedral we see standing there today.</p><p>Before Julius Caesar came to Gaul, the Druid's had already fashioned a statue in the image of a woman seated with a child upon her lap, for they somehow understood that there would be a woman who would give birth to a child like none other ever seen upon the face of the earth. Perhaps they knew of Isaiah's prophesy, \"...the Lord Himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and His name shall be called Emmanuel.\"</p><p>This image was kept on an altar in the crypt that bore the motto \u2018Virgini Pariturae' - \u2018to the virgin who will bear a child.' Even though they were pre-Christian, these Druids awaited the One who would prove the old gods to be nothing but mere idols of clay and stone. Later, with the coming of Christianity, they learned that the virgin and child foretold to them were the Blessed Virgin Mary and Our Lord Jesus Christ, and they converted and demonstrated joyful devotion to them in their image of Our Lady of Chartres.</p><p>The well the Abbot Orsini refers to also dates back to Gallic times and the Druids, and it was also located in the crypt. \u2018The Well of Strong Saints,' or \u2018Puits des Saints-Forts,' the Christians came to call it, for the bodies of many early Christian martyrs were cast into that well. The well can still be seen there, although it is now dry.</p><p>The ancient statue of Our Lady of the Underground was destroyed during the French Revolution, and a copy is now in its place. It is interesting to note that this depiction of the Divine Child seated upon His Mother enthroned is quite similar to later statues of the Middle Ages known as Sedes Sapientiae, or \u2018Seat of Wisdom,' such as can be seen in Our Lady of Louvain, that become very popular in the 13th century.</p><p>Thus, for many reasons, Chartres and Our Lady of the Underground have long been one of the main pilgrimage sites in France.</p>"

At the age of nine he was sent to a famous school in France at Chatillion-sur-Seine, kept by the secular priests of Saint Vorles. He was an intelligent student, greatly devoted to the Blessed Virgin. He later wrote several books about the holy Mother of God, and it is thought by many that no one speaks as sublimely of the Queen of Heaven as he does. Mary appeared to Bernard as he wrote and inspired him with heavenly words and wisdom. The most hardened sinners, heretics and agnostics Mary brought to him and she proved a bulwark to his efforts to lead men to her and to Christ, her Divine Son.</p><p>Early in his adult life Saint Bernard became sick, so sick that he was preparing himself for death. Feeling useless and barren, his infirmity and the attendant pains he experienced increased to such a degree that Bernard asked two of his brethren to go to the church and beg for heavenly relief from God.</p><p>The Blessed Virgin Mary herself soon appeared to St Bernard, entering his cell attended by St Lawrence and St Benedict. All three approached Saint Bernard and touched the parts of his body where the pain was the most severe, bringing immediate relief. St Bernard had also been troubled with an intense flow of saliva which would not cease, and that trouble was also immediately ended.</p><p>The saint was not completely cured, however, and although he did not die, it was yet some time before his health was completely restored to him. St Bernard used the time well, producing his first treatise on humility and pride, and \"his light began to shine as the morning sun.\"</p>"

A short distance from the town of Ath, the town of Chievres is located in the municipality of Wallon in the province of Hainaut in Belgium. In 2006 the total population was only 6,198. There is also a United States Air Base located nearby.</p><p>Sometime in the early part of the 12th century, near the church of Chievres, there was an elderberry tree located next to a spring that held a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It was probably one of the roadside shrines that existed all over Europe at that time. A young woman named Eva de Chievres (also spelled Eve, Ide, or Ida) decided to have a chapel built to house the statue and protect it from the weather.</p><p>It is interesting to note that Eva married a famous knight named Gilles de Chin. According to legend, the Blessed Virgin assisted this knight in slaying a dragon that was terrorizing the land around nearby Wasmes. Gilles was accidentally killed while contesting in a tournament in 1137, and Eva later retired to the abbey of Ghislenghien where she died at age 65.</p><p>The shrine Eva founded was originally known as Notre-Dame du Sehu, or Our Lady of the Elder, but it eventually became better known for the fountain located nearby, and thus became known as Notre-Dame de la Fontaine. The shrine was famous as a place of pilgrimage due to the numerous miraculous healings there, and was also a \"chapel of respite\" where stillborn babies were sometimes miraculously brought back to life long enough that they might be baptized and go to heaven.</p><p>Among the many miracles noted there, in the year 1315 a Norman pilgrim was cured of gout, an illness from which he was suffering in all his joints. He paid for the rebuilding of the chapel, and also to have another constructed in his homeland to honor Our Lady of Chievres. In the year 1568 there was another Norman by the name of Antoine Depres, who had come to Belgium for a lengthy hospital treatment which he hoped would be a remedy for the skin disease afflicting his legs. He was completely cured after visiting Our Lady of Chievres. The Archbishop of Cambrai conducted a rigorous investigation and proclaimed the cure miraculous the following year. In 1579 there was a man named Nicolas Lens who suffered from a contraction of his muscles or nerves so that his legs remained continually drawn up to his chest. Appearing before the statue of Our Lady, Nicholas' limbs were suddenly loosened and he ran to kneel before the image of Our Lady. In the years that followed he never failed to carry the processional cross while barefoot to give thanks to Mary and Our Lord for the miracle.</p><p>The chapel was rebuilt several times over the centuries, and in 1632 a well was made in its center that drew water from the spring.</p><p>The chapel was destroyed in 1789 as a result of the French Revolution. The statue of Our Lady was later found in the ruins and preserved in the church of Chievres. In 1893 Father Victor Duray organized construction of the present red brick chapel. In the present day there is a procession which takes place on the Sunday after Ascension Thursday. The statue of Our Lady of Chievres is carried in a beautiful Gothic-style litter.</p>"

Taking 12 monks with him, he stopped at a glen called Val d'Absinthe on 25 June 1115, founding Claire Vallee (Valley), which then later became known as \"Clairvaux.\" He became its first abbot of this celebrated monastery, but this was only the first of 70 monasteries Bernard was to found.</p><p>This feast day celebrates the dedication of the founding of the monastery at Clairvaux, in the diocese of Langres, in honor of the Blessed Virgin. This event is believed to have occurred in 1115, and not 1114, as shown in the Marian calendar. Saint Bernard had many grave difficulties to overcome at Clairvaux, as so often happens when one begins to do God's work. Despite all the trials, however, disciples flocked to Clairvaux, which made it necessary to found many new abbeys.</p><p>Saint Bernard died at Clarivaux in the year 1153, aged sixty-three years. His devotion to the Mother of God is universally known. Although he was originally buried at Clarivaux, this saint's earthly remains were moved to Troyes Cathedral when the abbey was seized by the atheistic French government. </p><p>Alphonsus I, King of Portugal, in the year 1142, bound himself and his successors to pay every year, as the vassal of Our Lady of Claivaux, fifty gold maravedis for the upkeep of the shrine. King Alphonsus I was responsible for building many monasteries and convents, and granting various privileges to many religious orders. It is said that the great Saint Bernard of Clairvaux was his uncle.</p><p>The original abbey founded by Saint Bernard is now nothing more than ruins, but what remains is protected by the French Ministry of Culture as an Historical monument since the year 1926.</p><p>Saint Bernard in his time was regarded as the apple of the Virgin's eye. He placed all his churches under the special protection of Mary. To him Mary was the great mediator. Not even the weakest human frailty could fear to approach this Mother.

        "eng": "<p>According to this account, the picture was originally sent to the Empress Saint Pulcheria, a princess, who placed it in the Church of Our Lady of the Guides, at Constantinople. From there it was taken by Leo, Duke of Russia. The Duke of Opolia wanted to remove it to his duchy in the year 1380, but when he had got to the mountain of Clermont, it became so heavy that it was impossible to carry it farther; and seeing by this miracle that the Blessed Virgin had chosen that mountain for her abode, they built a church there.</p><p>The Empress Saint Pulcheria was certainly a real person, living in Constantinople in the 5th century. Her full name was Aelia Pulcheria, and her father was Arcadius, Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire. When the emperor died, Pulcheria's seven year old brother Theodosius was made emperor, though there was a regent necessitated by his young age. When Theodosius became a teenager, Pulcheria became his regent and took a vow of virginity. Based on her charitable works, she appears to have lived her Catholic faith, as she built many churches, hospitals and public houses for the destitute. There is also a letter addressed to the saint by Pope Leo I in which the pontiff states in part, \"\u2026you clearly show how much you love the Catholic faith and how much you despise the errors of heretics.\" Pulcheria is responsible for at least three churches in Constantinople that were dedicated to the Blessed Virgin  -  the Blachemae, the Chalkoprateia, and the Hodegetria.</p><p>In Greek, Hodegetria translates to something like, \"She who guides, or who knows the way,\" which sounds quite similar to \"Our Lady of the Guides,\" or even, \"Our Lady of the Way,\" a title by which the icon was often known. The image, which shows the Blessed Mother and the Divine Child, was said to have been brought to Constantinople from the Holy Land. It was venerated at the Monastery church of the Panaghia Hodegetria, which was said to have been built specifically to house the icon, and was considered the most important \"cult object in Byzantium.\" On the reverse side of the icon was an image of the crucifixion.</p><p>The current location of the original icon of Our Lady of Clermont is now unknown. There are many copies that have been made from the original, and many of these are miraculous, but none of them are thought to be the original. The account above mentions a Leo, Duke of Russia, and there was a Leo, Duke of Russia, who rode with the Golden Horde under Talabuga in 1287 when a raid was made into Poland, so perhaps this is the Duke Leo mentioned who took the image back to Russia. Although Constantinople did not fall to the Turks until the year 1453, it was taken by siege during the Fourth Crusade, and many important relics were taken to the west. Perhaps the icon was one of those relics.</p><p>The Duchy of Opolia, or Opole, was a region situated along the Oder River in Central Europe, which was once an important trade route, and Opolia was a fortified city at about this time. There are numerous Catholic churches in Studio Clermont, Wroclaw, Poland, which is also located along the Oder River, and it may be that this was the region where the image became so heavy that it would not move any further, and that somewhere in Wroclaw was the last known location of the icon of Our Lady of Clermont.</p>"

This discovery made a sensation, and attracted the attention of the most illustrious noblemen of the time. Among these nobles, Simon de Melun, a great baron, who had accompanied King Saint Louis IX to Africa, and whom Philip the Fair elevated to the dignity of marshal of France, formed the intention of founding a collegiate church there, but death, which he gloriously met with at the siege of Courtray, prevented him from executing this pious project. It was his widow and son who made it their duty to accomplish.</p><p>After his victories in Flanders, Philip the Fair, who had prospered under the protection of Mary, was struck with the concourse of the faithful who repaired to Our Lady of Clery. He increased the number of the canons, and resolved to rebuild the church; but death, who defeats so many projects, religious as well as others, left him, in this respect, no other merit than his good intention.</p><p>The church, nevertheless, was begun in his reign, and continued, thanks to the munificence of his third son, Charles, Duke of Orleans. Philip of Valois, that noble prince, who said to his soldiers, in conquered countries, \"Respect the churches!\" caused that of Our Lady to be finished, which the English Salisbury pillaged during the celebrated siege of Orleans. King Louis XI, who would have new sleeves put to his old doublets, to wear them till they were threadbare, but who knew how to act his part as king, when he pleased, built the church of Clery. He donated to it 2,330 golden crowns, settled upon it great revenues, erected it into a royal chapel, and richly endowed its cannons.</p><p>This monument, the object of so many expenses, and so much care, was destroyed by a fire in 1472, as they had just finished covering it in. \"The whole was set on fire and burnt,\" says the chronicle of Louis XI; but the church was rebuilt anew under the inspection of the king's secretary.</p><p>Louis XI, having recovered his health at Clery, and attributing his recovery to the Blessed Virgin, enriched its collegiate church with fresh donations, and had his tomb prepared in it. \"He placed himself in it several times,\" says one of his historians, \"to see whether the place fitted his body, and was well proportioned to receive it after his death.\" He was interred there, according to his desire. His wife, Charlotte of Savoy, was laid there near him sometime after.</p><p>The Calvinists, who no more respected the tombs of kings than the altars of saints, broke into pieces the statue of Louis XI, and violated his royal tomb for the sake of plunder.

Don Luis de VelascoII, when he was Viceroy of New Spain, had as his confessor a Dominican, Fray Cristobal de Ortega, who also acted as his financial adviser. In gratitude for the friar's diligence and loyalty to his interests for many years, Don Luis presented the Dominican Order with the convent on the twelfth of March, 1595.</p><p>Shortly afterward, a Dominican religious, accompanied by a Lay Brother, had to go to Rome on business for the Order. The religious of the new Convent of La piedad commissioned him to bring back a painting of Our Lady under her title of La Piedad, that is, \"Compassion,\" representing the sorrowing Mother holding in her arms the lifeless body of her Divine Son. Rome in that day was the home of many outstanding painters, and the friar was charged with securing the best possible work of art.</p><p>On arrival, the religious asked an artist of great merit to accept the commission. The painter agreed, but would not set a date upon which he would undertake to have the picture ready. In vain the friar tried to fix the time, saying that he had to return to Mexico very soon, and could not leave without the painting. But the artist only replied that he could not promise it by any definite date, since he worked only when inspiration came to him.</p><p>Finally, when they came to an agreement on the conditions under which the artist would accept the assignment, the Dominican began to describe the general outlines of the picture he wanted. Brusquely the artist cut him short. He knew his business; all the good friar had to do was wait. When the painting was ready, he would be notified.</p><p>The Dominican left the studio with mixed emotions. He had secured the artist's promise, true. On the other hand, the great man had shown very little interest in the project.</p><p>Time went by, and no word came from the artist. Very soon the religious would have to return to Mexico. Finally he could wait no longer. With some misgivings he visited the studio. Had the painting been finished?</p><p>\"Finished?\" answered the artist, with haughty indifference. \"Why, I have scarcely begun to make a sketch of it!\"</p><p>The poor friar did not know what to do. His superiors had ordered him to leave for New Spain the following morning. For some time he stood in thought, and at last he said:</p><p>\"I will take back the sketch, at least, so that they may see it is no fault of mine.\"</p><p>\"And what good will a simple sketch do?\" asked the painter.</p><p>\"In Mexico, we shall find someone who can finish the painting.\"</p><p>\"Only one brush can complete this picture,\" replied the painter; \"mine!\"</p><p>\"But I mean, with the help of God!\" burst out the friar.</p><p>These words, uttered with such simple faith, shook the artist from his indifference  -  something that even a bag of gold pieces would not do  -  and he handed over the sketch.</p><p>A month later, the friar and his Lay Brother companion were in mid-ocean, bound for New Spain. Suddenly a storm arose, the like of which in ferocity and intensity the crew and passengers had never before experienced.</p><p>\"Padre! We shall be drowned!\" they cried in terror.</p><p>\"Have confidence in Our Lady, Star of the Sea,\" the priest answered serenely. \"She can calm the waters with a glance.\"</p><p>\"We will promise her a thank-offering if she spares our lives,\" they said.</p><p>\"Then let us make a promise to Our Lady,\" replied the friar, \"to build her a sanctuary in Mexico.\" And so they promised.</p><p>At once the storm began to subside, and soon the sea was calm again. The grateful crew and passengers, mindful of their promise, made generous offerings.</p><p>Shortly thereafter the ship arrived at Veracruz, and the two Dominicans made their way overland to Mexico City. Their fellow religious at the Convent of La Piedad were considerably chagrined to learn the inconsequential outcome of the friar's business with the Roman artist. Some complained that they might have secured a suitable painting in Mexico, for a fraction of the cost, and much more quickly. Others said it might be a chastisement from God for their vanity in choosing a famous artist to do the work. With many misgivings, they set about opening the crate in which the sketch had crossed the ocean. As they were unrolling the canvas, signs of color were seen, but they assumed that some paint had adhered to it in the artist's studio. Their astonishment increased as they continued unwrapping the canvas, and when it was exposed to view, they gazed at it in silence, unable to take their eyes from the painting. For painting it was, of extraordinary beauty and perfection, depicting the Mother of Jesus holding her crucified Son.</p><p>\"No doubt our brother sought to surprise us,\" said one.</p><p>\"But he would not tell a falsehood for that,\" replied others.</p><p>So absorbed were they in the painting that it was some time before they saw that the two newly returned religious were still on their knees before the picture, overcome by the marvelous outcome of events. When they were at last able to speak, they related the circumstances in which they had acquired a rough sketch for the painting. They added the tale of the storm at sea and the near-shipwreck. They told how the crew and passengers had come to them with the promise to build a shrine for the Virgin if she spared their lives. When they had concluded their recital, all agreed that the hand of God had played a part in the supernatural affair of the painting.</p><p>From that time the religious of the Convent of La Piedad preached devotion to Our Lady in her image. Notable miracles have been worked through her intercession, and many of the most outstanding have been certified by formal process before the ecclesiastical tribunal.</p><p>This venerable image today hangs in the new sanctuary of Our Lady of La Piedad. It is an oil painting on canvas nearly nine feet high and eight and a half feet in width, in a wood frame, today covered with glass. The picture symbolizes the supreme moment when the Son of God, having enacted the drama of Calvary, lay in the arms of His Mother. A soft, clear light illumines the whole, and the colors are as fresh and bright as though the scene had been painted yesterday, instead of more than three and a half centuries ago.</p><p>Many indulgences have been granted to the Church of La Piedad, and it has been erected into a Minor Basilica.</p>"

It gave rise to a devotion to Our Lady under the title of Mother of Confidence. This renowned reproduction of Our Lady of Confidence arrived at the capital of Christendom accompanied by a copy of a document written by the Servant of God with a promise to those who venerate the picture. The parchment is conserved today in the archives of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which is examining the case for Venerable Sister Clare Isabella's beatification.The seminary has always held the picture in great esteem. The students, having recourse to the miraculous image in their most pressing needs, always had their prayers answered by Our Lady. Noteworthy was the complete protection granted by Our Lady of Confidence to the seminarians against the scourge of Asiatic Cholera that claimed thousands of lives throughout Italy in 1837. When a new outbreak devastated the south of the country thirty years later and reached the City of the Pope, the protective mantle of the Madonna was again felt, granting immunity to the students of the seminary. During the First World War, the Blessed Virgin watched over the more than 100 seminarians who had recourse to her with redoubled confidence. Many seminarians were sent to the war and there are numerous letters written from the battlefield recounting the marvels worked by the Madonna for those who had sought her intercession.</p><p>The PromiseThe greatest graces reserved for all those who have this devotion are contained in the promise of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the venerable Sister Clare Isabella. Below is a translation of this marvelous promise taken from an old parchment containing the consoling words of the Blessed Mother to Sister Clare:\"The divine Lady deigned to reveal to me that every soul that confidently presents herself before this picture will obtain from her Divine Son the general pardon for all her sins. Moreover, my divine Lady assured me with the love of a true mother that she would grant a special tenderness and devotion toward her to everyone who contemplated this picture.\"With the ejaculatory prayer, \"My Mother my Confidence,\" explains a pamphlet published by the Roman seminary, Mary offers everything but asks for nothing. It is a most ardent and efficacious expression of complete abandonment and confidence in the hands of the Blessed Mother. Just as the Apostle Saint Thomas at the feet of the resurrected Redeemer exclaimed with confidence, \"My Lord and my God!\" so also should devotees of the Virgin, before this miraculous picture, repeat with heartfelt confidence those sweet words,</p>"

    "Our Lady of Conquest": {
        "eng": "<p>In the North Chapel of the beautiful cathedral of Santa Fe stands a little statue (scarcely three feet tall) of Our Lady holding the Child Jesus. It was skillfully carved by loving hands in Spain. Mary is clad in a richly embroidered dress, topped by a jeweled crown. Her regal countenance wears a serene, detached expression that is strangely impressive. This is Our Lady of Conquest, or La Conquistadora.</p><p>The statue of Our Lady of Conquest came to the new world in the care of the Franciscan missionary Fray Alonso da Venevides. She was installed with great ceremony in a church in Santa Fe. Over the ensuing decades, as often happens, the men living in the region did not practice their religion as they should. Mary appeared in a vision to a young girl, warning her that the colony would be overrun due to the loss of reverence for priests and the Faith.</p><p>In the year 1680 the local Indians rose up and attacked the Spanish. Twenty-one priests were killed, and the colonists completely driven out of the region. The statue was rescued from the burning church and taken back to Mexico with the colonists who escaped the wrath of the Indians.</p><p>It was not until the year 1691 that Don Diego de Vargas was sent by the King of Spain to attempt the resettlement of the city of Santa Fe. Like so many Spanish heroes who had accomplished seemingly impossible deeds during their lifetimes, he was as fervent a Catholic as he was a capable knight. Don Diego de Vargas carried with him the statue of Our Lady as he reentered New Mexico. Although he had only a small force, he was able to peacefully negotiate a peace with the various Indian nations. He attributed his success to \"the Sovereign Queen, Most Blessed Mary.\" He is said to have vowed to build a chapel for her and hold a yearly procession if she would grant him a speedy and blood-less victory over the Indian, which she did.</p><p>Upon reaching his goal, however, the Indians refused to allow the Spanish colonists to return to Santa Fe. The Spanish under Don Diego were few in number, and they were forced to fight a numerically superior force.</p><p>The colonists prayed the rosary before the statue of the Blessed Virgin as the men engaged the Indians in battle. The fighting lasted all day, and it was not until evening when they reclaimed the city. Once again, Mary was credited for the victory, and to show her sovereignty, Don Diego placed an officer's baton in her hand.</p><p>The shrine symbolizes a spirit of deep-rooted Faith and devotion which characterized the \"Conquistadores\" of this land. There is still a great deal of devotion shown to Mary at the Cathedral of St. Francis that includes processions, fiestas and other celebrations.</p><p>The statue was formally crowned by Cardinal Francis Spellman and in 1960 received a Papal Coronation.</p>"

    "Our Lady of Consolation": {
        "eng": "<p>Also known as Our Lady of Grace, or Notre-Dame-de-Grace, the first thing that can be seen among the trees upon the height is a large crucifix that seems to bless the sea, although the Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Grace is still invisible, hidden under the old trees that surround it. The present chapel is a small one located a short distance from that cross, and the tall trees and lawns that surround the church are in stark contrast to the church's humble dimensions.</p><p>Once inside, everything is modest but neat. There is a low arch, and passing beneath it the view from the windows inside is obscured by the thick foliage of the surrounding trees. On the Gospel side is the statue of the Blessed Virgin on a short pillar. A fabric canopy frames the statue which depicts the Mother of God holding her Divine Child.</p><p>At the feet of Our Lady are placed small anchors and hearts of silver gilt that shine on the dais, and we see a small amount of flowers that are the humble obeisance's of children and the poor. There are votive offerings hundreds of years old, and paintings of ships battered by storms, or broken upon the rocks, beneath which are brief accounts of the perils and the salvation sent after prayer to Notre-Dame-de Grace. Crutches lean against the wall as trophies demonstrating the victorious prayers of the healed cripples who now walk, and burning candles are constantly renewed beneath the holy image, exhibiting the persevering ardor of the faithful. It is a collective testimony of piety and edification from the servants of Mary.</p><p>The origin of the pilgrimage to Notre-Dame de Grace goes back to the eleventh century. According to tradition, in the year 1034, Robert the Magnificent, Duke of Normandy, was sailing to England. He was suddenly assailed by a violent storm, and at the height of the danger he promised to build three chapels and devoted to the Blessed Virgin if he returned safely to his lands. The storm ended at once, and the prince immediately returned home to take care of his vow. He built one of the chapels promised near his castle, and dedicated it to Our Lady of Mercy. Another he built near Caen, which he called Notre-Dame de la Deliverance, and the third he built on the plateau overlooking Honfleur, which was named Notre Dame de Grace.</p><p>This chapel near Honfleur soon became a busy place of pilgrimage. There is an authentic document at the church from King Louis XI dated January 28, 1478, and letters showing that the chapel was endowed with a certain tract of land containing a house, a barn, etc.</p><p>The chapel partially collapsed, and the sea swallowed part of the cliff near the church during a violent earthquake that occurred on September 29, 1538. Only a section of one wall, the altar, and the statue of the Virgin Mary remained standing, but such was the devotion of the people to this special place that many pilgrims continued to come and pray kneeling amid the debris. Unfortunately the landslides did not cease, so finally, in 1602, the last vestiges of the sanctuary were removed to prevent the faithful from exposing their lives to the unremitting danger.</p><p>The faithful regretted the loss of their chapel, and one of them, Mr. Gonnyer, undertook to raise a new one. He dug the foundations one hundred paces from the old church to the south-west, but he was forced to stop at that point for lack of money. Offerings from the inhabitants of Honfleur did the rest, and in 1613 the chapel was raised, but she felt the poverty that prevailed in France at that time. It was a small building three times as long as it was wide; thatched, isolated among the heather, and looked more like a barn than a chapel.</p><p>The Capuchins took possession on March 16, 1621, and they planted a large wooden cross amid the ruins of the old chapel. They eventually replaced it with a stone cross that they placed closer to the chapel than the old one had been.</p><p>In the Middle Ages people understood that the Church provided for the moral and physical welfare of the people as well as the state. They knew that the apostolate of the monastic orders was necessary to form and maintain the ties of charity between the rich and poor, adjust the opulent life of one to soften the sufferings of others, and to communicate to all, through preaching and by example, the secret of living and dying well.</p><p>When the Revolution broke out, there was wide-spread desecration in the whole of France, and all religious communities were dissolved. In vain the faithful recipients of so many graces endeavored to protect their sanctuary and the religious who served there. At one time it was hoped Honfleur could keep the Capuchins, and so a petition was drafted for that purpose in 1790.</p><p>\"Through the removal of religious communities,\" said the petitioners, \"we fear being deprived of the significant relief that we receive from the Capuchins. These men are religious at all times, labor for the good of the city and the neighboring country, and through the uprightness of their intentions and the justice of their actions they have earned public esteem and confidence. They have a small chapel, located on the coast under the invocation of the Blessed Virgin, which is held in great reverence throughout the country, and we urge its conservation.\"</p><p>The petition was sent to the National Assembly, who refused it. The chapel was plundered and converted into a tavern. The old statue was destroyed, and sadly \"those who were but lately to pray and ask for graces forgot themselves to commit orgies in a place where everything, even the walls, reproached them for their apostasy.\"</p><p>That was so long ago, and now the tides of commercial prosperity have come to caress the people and promote the development of the city and the port of La Havre. Hanfleur possesses all the signs of a prosperous city that is increasing in wealth and population, regardless of the attendant demoralization and miseries of every kind that accompany the seeming prosperity. La Havre is the seat of business where speculators contest in the commercial sphere where they work without ceasing to earn their fortune and contribute to each other's ruin. Without the aid of the Blessed Virgin, there was no longer any hope for relief.</p><p>Still, it was here, at this remote chapel about 5 kilometers from Honfleur, that Marie-Francoise-Therese Martin came with her father and sister Celine in July of the year 1887 to pray to Notre-Dame-de Grace that she might be able to enter Carmel. That woman is better known today as Saint Therese of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face, or simply Therese of Lisieux, the \"Little Flower.\"</p>"

We do not know much about the Byzantine past of the building, we only know for certain that the church was transferred to the Dominicans in 1475, and it took the name of Our Lady of Constantinople, and later, that of Saint Mary of the Rosary.</p><p>In 1640 Our Lady of Constantinople was converted into a mosque in the name of Kemankes, then Odalar camii.

However, the proximity of the mosque Kasim Aga, which also has Byzantine structures, and the Aetius (Ipek Bodrumu) suggest that the church belonged to a large monastery, whose name remains unknown.</p><p>From the point of view of the two archaeologists, the foundations of the church date from the seventh century, but the final form of the church was given after the fire of 1203. After the reconstruction and expansion of the church in the thirteenth century, the foundations of the old church were used as a mausoleum, while two slightly asymmetrical chapels were added in the apse. Part of the old church was filled to construct the new church with the Greek cross plan. Nothing suggests that the substructure of the second building was originally a funerary chapel, as its primary function was to provide a basis for a monumental church. It appears the sub-structure was gradually used for tombs of the faithful.</p><p>In the upper part, there are paintings of the life of the Blessed Virgin dating from the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Fragments of frescoes have been discovered on several walls. In the small central chamber of the crypt, a crowned Virgin surrounded by angels suggests that a Marian relic may have once been enshrined here.</p>"

They called upon the Virgin to intercede for them, and, they were landed safely on the Brazilian shores. In token of gratitude, they called the spot Copacabana  -  and it has since become one of the world's favorite resorts.</p><p>In Bolivia, however, the original Copacabana does not suggest gay social life; it spells a wonderful story of faith and love. Enclosed by beautiful sloping mountains overlooking the Mary-blue of Lake Titicaca, lies the tiny cove called Sepa-cabana or Copacabana. The name means \"one who looks at the precious stone,\" because in the distance, lovely to see, stretches the majestic, ice-capped necklace of the Cordillera of the Andes. In this spot in the days of the Inca Empire, lived good Indians whose sole duty was to prepare for journeys of worshippers to the Island of the Sun, some miles out on the lake. Copacabana, accordingly, became the center of much Incaion activity, for the Incas were fanatic in their visits to the island shrine.</p><p>The missionaries who came with the Spanish conquerors naturally planted the cross in all large Incan centers, and a church was built in Copacabana. It was dedicated to St Ann. However, The Mother of the Blessed Virgin seemed to frown on this honor, for the town soon fell into disrepute and the harvests were poor. Many of the Indians moved away until only a few souls remained. Those who stayed believed that if the town were dedicated to some other saint, the town might prosper; but the agreement on the identity of the new patron could never be reached.</p><p>In the year 1581, a young Indian lad, Francisco Yupanbi, desired earnestly that his town be dedicated to Our Lady. In secret he started to construct a statue of the Virgin and Child to be presented to the village. For more than a year he labored day and night. When he called in the townspeople to see the result, they laughed at him in scorn, for Francisco knew nothing of art, and his statue proved it. Undaunted, but burning with the desire to complete the task, the youth went off to visit all the great cities of Bolivia in order to study under the masters who were decorating churches and monasteries.</p><p>Finally after months of disappointments and successes, he finished his labor of love, Our Lady of Copacabana  -  a Virgin with all of the features of his own race, in her arms an Infant no different than the thousands of Indian Babies Francisco had known so well. He called in his teachers and other artists, and they were astonished; he had created a veritable work of art; but for him it was a labor of love, representing his \"Little Mother,\" the Virgin who could save his native town of Copacabana. He hastened with his precious burden to his home; but as he arrived, he was met by a delegation of citizens, who had come to drive him and his silly lump of plaster away.</p><p>But the Virgin, Our Lady of Copacabana, smiled on Francisco; when the box was opened the hostile attitude changed; when they saw the love that had been caught in the face of the Madonna, they welcomed Francisco and his dear burden to the town. There were soon many miracles attributed to devotion to the new statue of Our Lady of Copacabana. The warmth of love engulfed Copacabana, and soon a church was built for the Mother and her Child. Jewels from devout persons far and near poured into the shrine to adorn Our Lady of Copacabana; distant pilgrims came day after day.</p><p>Francisco entered a monastery where he died a happy, holy man. Many legends grew up around his statue; it is said that if you look at her and think her beautiful, that is a sign that you are in her favor; if not, your soul is ugly. Many cures and miracles have been attributed to this Virgin, the greatest, that of faith  -  she stands as a monument of the faith of Francisco Yupanbi and to the faith of the millions of Indians who came after him; of poor and rich, mighty and lowly, who have revered this simple piece of clay that reminds them of their \"Mamita,\" the little Mother of everyone. The Blessed Virgin Mary is the patron saint of Bolivia, and the shrine of Our Lady of Copacabana is one of the oldest shrines in the Americas.</p>"

The city's name was changed to Coutances in honor of the Roman Emperor Constantius Chlorus. Due to its strategic location, it quickly rose to a place of great significance in the Empire.</p><p>According to tradition, the knowledge of salvation came to Coutances in the 5th century through Saint Ereptiolous. It is known that he built a church on the site where there had once been a pagan temple.</p><p>After the destruction of the Western Roman Empire, Coutances suffered from invasions by the Scandinavians and Normans in the 9th century. The church was razed and the city abandoned, and the bishop forced to flee for safety to Rouen. They did not go back to Coutances until nearly one hundred and sixty years later, when they returned with the assistance of Duke Richard the Fearless.</p><p>In the year 1030, Bishop Robert began the construction of a new cathedral, Our Lady of Coutances, which was begun in the Romanesque style. He died shortly after the labor of love had begun, and it was left to Bishop Geoffry de Mombray, who had been appointed in 1048. He completed the cathedral in the year 1056.

        "eng": "<p>The story of Our Lady of Covadonga begins with King Pelayo and his small army of three hundred men. They lived together as free men in the Cantabrian Mountains shortly after the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. His was a tiny kingdom that extended for only ten miles in any direction, but it was a summit that stood clear above the tide that had submerged the rest of Spain. His defiance of Muslim rule must have seemed almost futile and insignificant, but the Muslims eventually learned of it and sent a large army to crush the Christian resistance.</p><p>It was the spring of the year 722 when the Muslims finally appeared in the valley to dislodge Pelayo from his lofty peak. Thousands upon thousands of Muslim warriors scaled the steep slopes toward the cave in which Pelayo awaited them.</p><p>Amid the mountainous crags of Pelayo's realm there is a cave that is now known as St Mary of Covadonga. There, Pelayo and his men prayed to the Blessed Virgin Mary for her assistance and intercession before God as the power of Islam was about to be unleashed against them. Her favor they obtained, in a very remarkable way.</p><p>The following day the Moors advanced to kill Pelayo and destroy any last vestige of resistance to their rule in Spain. As soon as they were within range, the Moors began to fire arrows and other projectiles at Pelayo and his men. The arrows and stones turned, however, and came crashing down upon the ones who fired them. Pelayo's men sent boulders down upon their enemy, and started avalanches that swept many of them away. Although they initially fled, the Muslims were not to be easily overcome, and soon regrouped for another attack.</p><p>As the Moors advanced a second time, again they were treated to a shower of rocks and boulders while the sky darkened at the approach of a thunderstorm bursting with lightning and heavy rain. At first the rain made the rocks treacherous and slippery, but as it continued it loosened the stones and cast them down upon the ill-fated Moors. Still, for every one who fell there were two to take his place.</p><p>Suddenly a strange light appeared in the cave of Covadonga, and in its midst the Mother of God appeared to Pelayo and his beleaguered men. She bore a red shield with a white cross, with the holy name of \"Jesus\" upon it. Speaking to Pelayo, she said, \"Take courage. The Moors are wavering. Go out now and attack them in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall conquer.\"</p><p>Having delivered her message, the Mother of God, Our Lady of Covadonga, disappeared and the supernatural illumination faded. When Pelayo emerged from the darkness of the cave a moment later, his eyes blazed with resolve. Filled with newfound confidence, his men swept out from the cave to hurl the Moors from the slopes.</p><p>Thwarted by the fury of the thunder storm, their precarious hold on the mountain fast giving way beneath their feet, the Moors fled for their lives as they perceived their approaching doom. Pelayo's men rushed upon them, and with renewed conviction sent down more arrows and boulders after them, and many more were carried away to their death. When the survivors reached the floor of the valley below, the River Deva had been turned into a raging torrent that swept still more away.</p><p>Thanks to Our Lady of Covadonga, Pelayo's victory was such that the Moors were completely driven from the mountain, although enough survived to tell the tale of their defeat. Their general, Alqama, had been slain, and governor Munuza - he who had sent Pelayo to Cordoba in chains - had been uprooted. Never again did the Moors dare to enter Pelayo's domain to contest with him.</p><p>This victory marked the first time that the Moors were defeated, and was the beginning of what is now called the Reconquista, or Reconquest of Spain, which lasted well over 700 years.</p>"

India was one of the countries that had the privilege of receiving the light of Faith at the dawn of Christianity.</p><p>History relates that Saint Thomas the Apostle came to India at Cranganor in 52 AD. There the Christians are still known as Saint Thomas Faithful. Kerala, as the place is also known, is cut off by the mountain ranges from the rest of India, and has held firmly to the Faith, regardless of the gloom of the rest of the continent. The deep spirituality of the Catholics evidences their great love for the Mother of God, Our Lady of Cranganor. Nala-bat as the country is likewise called, may be translated as Mary's country, Mary's namesake. It is believed that when Saint Thomas came to Cranganor, he brought with him a picture of Our Lady, painted by Saint Luke; this was lost after Saint Thomas' martyrdom, but later discovered in a cave at Little Mount, Madras, near the scene of his death.</p><p>In 1498 when the Portuguese arrived in Cranganor, they were surprised to find so many churches dedicated to Mary. Saint Francis Xavier found the people of Cranganor very strong in faith and devoted to Mary, Our Lady of Cranganor; he spared no pains to flame their devotion to the Mother of God.</p><p>One may wonder why devotion to Mary took root and blossomed so strongly in Kerala  -  almost as though it met some deep religious and psychological need. Perhaps the reason for such spontaneous devotion is to be found in the position of the mother in the Hindu family. For while love, obedience, devotion and dependence on one's mother are natural to all peoples and nations, in Cranganor the exalted position of the mother assumes singular, if not unique, proportions. The mother is everything in the family; to depend on her is a deep-rooted tendency of all children in Kerala. Much more than the father, the mother is the bread-winner in the family. She owns, buys, and sells property and governs the house without any consultation with the father; he may frequently be away, but she always remains at home in the house. Her brothers have no right to property, only a living allowance and accommodations. Now this matriarchal system has been carefully guarded by the majority of Hindus. It lies at the very heart of the traditional way of life in Kerala; a time-honored custom which has helped to give Marian devotion an easy welcome and speedy growth.</p><p>Saint Ignatius of Loyola always wore the rosary conspicuously over his cassock. To his great satisfaction, Our Lady's \"Madre de Dios\" church was assigned to him on his arrival at Cochin, replacing Cranganor as the port of traffic with the western world. When Saint Francis arrived, he found a Confraternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary already established and he fostered this zealously during his lifetime.</p>"

On a nearby hill  -  the Bright Hill, Jasna Gora in Polish  -  the Monks of St Paul the Hermit have a monastery. In the chapel of Our Lady in their monastery church, is the famous painting of the Blessed Virgin. This painting of the Mother of God holding the Child Jesus in her arms, bears the title, Our Lady of the Bright Hill (Jasna Gora) she is the Patroness and Protectress of the Poles; the Queen of the Crown in Poland.</p><p>The history of Our Lady of Czestochowa is the history of Poland. Traditional holds that this picture of Mary was done by St Luke the Evangelist on a piece of wood cut from the table of the Last Supper. It was the Christians of Jerusalem who presented this picture to St Helen, the mother of Constantine. She in turn gave it to her son and so it was put in his palace at Constantinople. The salvation of this city while besieged by the Saracens was ascribed to Our Lady's intercession. The Byzantine Emperors showed great devotion for this picture and were able to hide it during the Iconoclast (breaking of images) persecution, thus saving it from destruction at the hands of the heretics who tried to destroy all statues and images. In 989, upon the marriage of Princess Anna, the sister of the Emperor, to Prince Vladimir of Kiev, the picture of Our Lady of Czestochowa was a wedding gift taken to her, to the Ukraine.</p><p>In the fourteenth century the picture was again in danger due to the Tartar raids. In a dream the wish of Our Lady was made known to Prince Ladislaus of Opol and in fulfillment of it, the holy image was taken to Jasna Gora. At that time the monks of St Paul the Hermit were invited to come from Hungary and be the custodians of the shrine. During the Hussite persecution, heretic s plundered the monastery and the church. They hurled the precious image of Our Lady of Czestochowa to the ground and it was broken into three pieces. But when they tried to carry it off, the wagon bearing the image could not be moved. In rage one of them drew a sword and struck Our Lady's cheek twice. As he raised his arm a third time he fell dead on the spot. Seeing this, his comrades fled in terror.</p><p>Under King Ladislaus II of Poland a commission of artists restored the painting but no effort on their part could remove the sword strokes which remain to this day. These artists at the time placed a silver background over the upper part of the picture on which five scenes were engraved. These are: the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Christ child, the Scourging at the Pillar, Christ mocked by the soldiers, and St Barbara, to whom Poles had a great devotion.</p><p>The Kings of Poland were especially devoted to Our Lady of the Bright Hill; at her shrine they, with their people sought intercession in all needs of the nation. In danger from the Turks, during invasion by Swedes, under siege by Prussians, Austrians and Russians, after the partition of Poland in 1795, during the German invasion of 1939, and today under Communism, the hearts of Poles have ever turned to Our Queen. Her shrine at Jasna Gora is for them a symbol of their faith and hope.</p><p>On May 7, 1957, Polish Catholics entered the first year of the \"GREAT NOVENA\" as their nine-year program of prayer is called. It was in 1956 that a million Polish pilgrims visited the shrine and out of that pilgrimage grew the Jasna Gora Vow, to prepare for the 1000 anniversary of Poland's conversion, known as the Sacred Millennium, by nine years of prayer and work for a Christian life. Thus today, even though the picture of Our Lady of Czestochowa is framed in somber black, the Polish Catholics turn once aging to Mary and hold themselves loyal subjects of the Queen of the Crown of Poland, Our Lady of Jasna Gora or Czestochowa.</p>"

The image is miraculous.</p><p>The city of Damietta, situated at the mouth of one of the branches of the Nile, was taken by the Muslims through treachery in the eighth century. They then successfully defended the fortified city against the Greeks, who repeatedly tried to recover it. They also survived the assaults of King Amaury I of Jerusalem.</p><p>Damietta was finally taken by the knight Jean de Brienne in the year 1219, after a difficult siege lasting over a year. The mosque was made into a church in honor of the Blessed Virgin by the King of Jerusalem and the Legate. It was here that Saint Francis of Assisi stopped before going to speak with the Sultan in an effort to convert him. Unfortunately, the Christians did not hold Damietta very long, as in the year 1221 the Crusaders were defeated and forced to give up Damietta. </p><p>In the year 1249 King Saint Louis IX of France went on crusade to the Holy Land, determined to take Damietta and keep it. The Crusaders at that time believed that Egypt was the key to maintaining control of the region, but a storm rose up before they could make land. When the King finally reached the coastline near Damietta, he had only a third of his companions with him, for the rest of the ships had been scattered in all directions.</p><p>The Sultan's army was waiting on the beach, the gold in their armor glistening in the morning light. Their numbers were so great, and their eagerness to dispute the landing so apparent, that some of the French knights wondered if it were prudent to proceed.</p><p>King Louis had the Oriflamme unfurled, and then gallantly attacked. The courage of the knights more than made up for their lack of numbers, and soon the enemy were repulsed. In a short time the French royal standard could be seen atop the highest tower of Damietta. The mosque of El-Fatah was consecrated into a church and a bishop, Gilles, was installed. The fact that King Louis intended the conquest to be permanent is demonstrated by the endowment he had drawn up for the cathedral church of Damietta.</p><p>In the year 1259, King Louis decided to take his forces to Cairo. His supply lines were cut, and his men began to succumb to various diseases, so it was decided to retreat to Damietta. The king remained with the rear guard, and although he fought well, he was overwhelmed and captured. As part of the ransom for himself and his men, Saint Louis was forced to give up Damietta and a large amount of gold.</p><p>The Arabs attempted to make Saint Louis swear an oath that he would keep his word about the treaty to which he had agreed. If he should break his oath he was required to accept that it meant he esteemed himself as a reprobate who denied God and Our Lady, that he separated himself from the communion of the saints, renounced God's law, and spat and trampled on the Cross, the sign of man's redemption.</p><p>Saint Louis refused to take such an oath, and no threat of mistreatment, torture or threats of death could make him accept the blasphemous oath. \"I would rather die a true Christian than live beneath the Almighty's wrath,\" he calmly answered their threats.</p><p>Still, the ransom was eventually paid, and Saint Louis with his queen and about 6,000 of his men, left Egypt and embarked for Acre. When word later came to the Sultan that Saint Louis was planning on returning, he had Damietta razed to the ground with its castle, leaving only the mosque of El-Fatah.</p>"

The image was a beautiful little statue that depicted Mary cuddling at her breast the Infant Jesus whom she was lovingly nursing.</p><p>A poor peasant returning from the fields after making a visit to the shrine, recognized the statue in the possession of the drunken soldier. He bought the statue for a small sum of money, and carried it home to enshrine it in his humble cottage. It chanced that this man's wife was nearing childbirth, so daily the couple knelt before the statue begging the Mother of God to give the expectant mother a safe delivery.</p><p>As the days passed, it was evident that there were difficulties, and that the wife of the poor peasant was certainly threatened with death. The father prayed most fervently before the image of Mary for his wife's safety. His confidence was rewarded by a happy delivery vouchsafed by the Little Mother, as he lovingly referred to the statue. He named the statue accordingly, the Mother of Safe Delivery, which also became known as Our Lady of Deliverance.</p><p>The news spread rapidly, and Mary's devotees, finding themselves under similar circumstances as the peasant's wife, frequented the home until it became too small to accommodate all of them. A chapel was built for Our Lady of Deliverance, and later a church named after Saint Martin. The statue of the Mother of Safe Delivery was removed with great pomp; nobility and peasant alike knelt in prayer in their personal and family needs. Our Lady recognized all as her children, bestowing safe deliveries where requested.</p><p>This devotion also spread to the New World with the Spanish colonization of Florida. In the 1600's the Conquistadors brought the image to Saint Augustine, known to them as Nuestra Senora de la Leche y Buen Parto, Our Lady of the Milk and Safe Delivery. It became the scene of one of the first known Marian Shrines in what was to become the United States of America.</p>"

Afterward, in atonement to Our Lady for this insult, the faithful of France rebuilt the shrine, and pleaded that the Holy See grant numerous relics and valuable keepsakes to be placed there. Our Blessed Mother responded to the generosity and love of the people by granting favors and cures and extending her God-given miraculous power over the people.</p><p>In 1944 the German army occupied the city of Dijon.

The first apparition occurred on May 8th when she cured Bartolomeo of his disability and told him to preach penance to the inhabitants of Fossano.</p><p>In a second apparition on May 11th, the Blessed Virgin brought Bartolomeo three loaves of bread and again asked him to preach penance to the people of Fossano. The latter, however, only ridiculed the visionary. A short time later, however, a plague broke out among the Fossanesse, who only then had recourse to Our Lady. After having been granted a release from the plague through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the grateful people of the region had a chapel built which was known as Our Lady of Divine Providence. This chapel was later replaced with a larger church between 1634 and 1642.</p><p>In 1600 the Augustinian Brothers of the Congregation of Genoa came to Cussanio and the friars built the great monastery complex next to the sanctuary.

His bride to be is said to have been a member of the Roman imperial family, but Alexis wanted to give his life to God, and did not wish to be married. In obedience to the wishes of his parents, Alexis did marry, but after the ceremony, by Divine Inspiration, he removed his wedding band and gave it back to his bride.</p><p>Apparently Alexis' bride had consented to this, and so Alexis left Rome in secret and took ship to Syria.

Not knowing the circumstances of his disappearance, his family searched for him in vain for many years.</p><p>Saint Alexis was content to live a beggar's life, surviving off the meager alms he obtained each day after praying before the image of the Blessed Virgin at the shrine. He spent much of the rest of his time caring for the sick and infirm at Edessa's hospital. He never spoke of himself, or of the life he had left behind, and there were none to whom he ever revealed his name.One day the image venerated by Saint Alexis spoke to a sacristan, defending the saint while also revealing that Alexis was a \"Man of God\" and making known his holiness to all the people of Edessa.Saint Alexis, seeing himself as nothing but a lowly beggar, found he was suddenly venerated as a holy man. Humbled by the revelation of Our Lady of Edessa, he fled the city for a place where he could remain unknown. He boarded a ship to Tarsus, but a storm forced the ship to the Italian coast. Seeing the hand of God in this, and following Divine Inspiration, Saint Alexis returned to his boyhood home on Aventine Hill in the city of Rome.</p><p>The parents of Saint Alexis were still alive, but they did not recognize their own son in the ragged beggar he had become. He who was heir to a noble title and magnificent property was given modest employment and a miserable corner beneath the stairs where he could sleep.

Saint Alexis spent the remaining 17 years of his life as a stranger in his own home, suffering the contempt and buffets of his father's servants in patience and humility.</p><p>When Saint Alexis died, the church bells rang of their own accord. Pope Innocent I was celebrating Mass when he was interrupted by an unseen voice telling him to \"Seek the man of God.\" The Roman Emperor joined Pope Innocent in the search, and the two, guided by the mysterious voice, found the body of Saint Alexis where he had expired under the staircase.When Saint Alexis was found he held a scroll detailing the account of his life that God had commanded he put down in writing, and this document also revealed his identity. Alexis' parents were deeply saddened to learn that the beggar who had lived beneath the stairs and eaten the scraps from their table had actually been their own son, though they also realized that he was a saint who had suffered all for the love of God.</p><p>Saint Alexis was buried in Saint Peter's Basilica, though his remains were later transferred to the church of Saint Boniface on the Aventine Way in Rome.

A pilgrim was introduced who was going alone and barefoot to Our Lady of the Hermits. The pilgrim had been compelled to beg hospitality at the approach of a tempest which already made the great pines of a neighboring forest creak, and the waves of the lake roar.</p><p>The lord arose from his place and courteously led his new guest to the corner of a wide Gothic fireplace, where whole trunks of oak were burning. This duty fulfilled, Berthold, without any respect for the austere presence of the traveler, resumed the foolish and impious discourse which he had interrupted, now and then giving a side-look at the pilgrim to ascertain the effect produced upon him by his audacious and wicked words, but the pale and emaciated countenance of the holy man preserved the immobility of marble.</p><p>When the feast was over the guests called for their horses, to return to their several homes.</p><p>\"The night is dark,\" said the lord to the young miscreant, who had the honor to belong to his family. \"You have to pass through a defile which is haunted by those wandering spirits who move about the world in the dark, to do mischief\u2026I am afraid you may meet with some sad adventure; believe me, and stay here.\"</p><p>\"Bah!\" replied the officer, laughing, who was in the service of France. \"I fear neither God nor the devil!\"</p><p>\"Are you quite sure of that?\" said the pilgrim in a tome of dark raillery, which frightened the rest.</p><p>\"So sure, my good pilgrim, that I drink to Lucifer, and ask him to escort me tonight, if he is disengaged.\"</p><p>\"You would richly deserve it!\" cried the lord of the place.</p><p>\"We will pray to Our Lady of Einsiendeln for you,\" said the traveler. \"You will stand in need of it.\"</p><p>\"I will not trouble you to do so,\" replied Berthold, saluting the holy man in derision.</p><p>A few minutes later Berthold was on horseback and singing the burden of a Bacchanalian song, as he descended the sloping heath which was crowned by the little fortified castle.

At length he arrived at the dangerous place to which his relative had alluded, and which bore the name of The Devil's Way, a name common enough in Switzerland.</p><p>It was a deep gorge, hollowed out between the red sides of two mountains, a sinister place where the Alpine goatherd would hardly have trusted himself in broad daylight. At that late hour, when the stillness and darkness made superstitions formidable, the young Swiss, uneasy at times, would keep his hand upon his sword.</p><p>Berthold was not insensitive to the feeling of dread, though he laughed aloud at his fear, ashamed at himself. \"I have solemnly called upon Lucifer to serve me as a torch-bearer,\" said the miscreant, who wanted to give his pride the satisfaction of a bravado; \"but he turns a deaf ear\u2026or else all hell is empty.\"</p><p>The thunder rolled at a distance, and a long flash of lighting lit up the woods and mountains, letting him see two hideous dwarfs standing at his horse's head.</p><p>\"Ah!\" said the officer, who felt himself growing pale. Then, resuming all his insolence, he said: \"Begone, infernal crew!\" Drawing and furiously brandishing his sword, he cried: \"Ye two miserable dwarves! You might frighten a cowherd of the Alps!\"</p><p>The Dwarves disappeared, and the galloping of two horses, who came down the almost vertical steep of the mountain, as swift as the wind, made Berthold quickly turn his head. They were two horsemen, covered with black armor, and mounted on horses of the same color. Their eyes glared like burning lamps through their visors, which were down. On their arms were hung, by a small chain of polished steel, the battle club of ancient Germany, which is a club covered with iron spikes that appeared still red with human blood; and a lurid aura of light played on their helmets.</p><p>The dark horsemen ranged themselves, in silence, on either side of the pale officer and snatched the reins from his trembling hands. A moment later and the three set off with the swiftness of the wind.</p><p>Mountains after mountains disappeared, sparks of fire were struck from the flint stones of the roads; the distance was no sooner perceived than it was swallowed up.</p><p>Soon they passed over the frail bridges of flexible branches, beneath which cataracts roar, and where the bold chamois hunter hardly dares to set his foot. Thus they reached the region of eternal snows, and the horses redoubling their furious pace, made for a gulf at the bottom of which rolled, at a depth which made one giddy, a torrent the noise of which was scarcely perceptible.</p><p>All of a sudden, from the midst of those dark waters, reddened at intervals by subterraneous fires, a multitude of hallow and hoarse voices were heard.</p><p>\"Vengeance! Vengeance!\" they cried. \"Give up the seducer, the false friend, the duelist, to us!\"</p><p>\"We are bringing him!\" replied the horsemen, brandishing their heavy battle-clubs. A cold sweat ran down from the forehead of Berthold; his hair stood on end with fear, and his features shrunk up with convulsions of horror  -  for among these accusing voices there were the well-known accents of voices which went to his very soul; remorse began to speak as loudly as fear!</p><p>\"Give up to us the lawless gambler, the detractor, the blasphemer, the false swearer!\" cried out the voices from the abyss.</p><p>The dark guides of Berthold, laughing in the hollow of their helmets, with a kind of metallic grin, horrible to hear, replied loudly to the subterranean voices, \"We are bringing him! We are bringing him!\"</p><p>\"Bring us the impious wretch!\"</p><p>\"We bring him!!!\" howled out the black horsemen.</p><p>Berthold almost lost his senses.</p><p>Already the three travelers were close to the extreme edge of an abrupt rock, at the bottom of which was the hollow abyss which clamored so imperiously for the Helvetian nobleman. Another second and all would be over for him!</p><p>But, behold! All at once the two horsemen, in the middle of a furious gallop, suddenly became motionless, like two equestrian statues of black marble. The faint sound of a bell had just died away upon the snow-covered plain - it was the midnight office which was rung at Our Lady of Einsiedeln.</p><p>Berthold understood that the influence of the Blessed Virgin had paralyzed the terrible power which was dragging him to hell.</p><p>Hastily making the sign of the cross, Berthold recommended himself ardently and sincerely to the protecting Madonna, Our Lady of Einsiendeln, who seemed to interpose herself between him and the exemplary punishment which he acknowledged, with compunction that he had deserved.</p><p>The bell ceased, and the young officer felt a horrible palpitation of his heart when he saw the two horsemen violently moving upon their black chargers. But the voice of repentance had penetrated to the starry throne of Mary, and the phantoms, after gestures of rage and regret, precipitated themselves to the bottom of the gulf, leaving Berthold on the very edge of it.</p><p>The moon, which had quite cleared itself from the clouds which had before darkened the sky, shone like a golden lamp in the height of the firmament, and magnificently lighted up the landscape. The officer discovered, to his great surprise, that he was on one of the highest shelves of Mount Rigi, from which he had great difficulty in descending. It goes without saying that he descended Mount Rigi to the church of Our Lady of Einsiendeln a changed man.</p><p>Some days afterwards the young lord went barefoot to Our Lady of Einsiendeln to the profound astonishment of his festive companions, and made a vow, in expiation of his past conduct, that no beverage should henceforth pass his lips but the water of the spring. He edified all who met him by his new, and much more pious, conduct.</p>"

All we need do is keep our hand tightly clasped in hers, walk in her footsteps, remain securely under the protection of her mantle, and never fear, but be secure and safe until she clasps us in her arm eternally to lead us to the throne of her Son to enjoy the mansion He is even now preparing for us.</p>"

    "Our Lady of Faith": {
        "eng": "<p>Not far from the small town of Dinant, in the country of Liege near a home belonging to the lord of Celles, two magnificent oaks once grew. One of the two venerable old trees was felled in the year 1609 for lumber. The worker who inspected the tree found in the interior a small statue of the Mother of God, enthroned, as it were, with three iron bars that served as a trellis. Apparently, at some time in the distant past, some pious Christian soul had placed the holy image in a hollow of the oak, as if in a niche. Then, over a period of time, the opening the tree had made while it was still young gradually closed, and as it grew, the tree hid in its womb the precious figure.</p><p>To honor the Virgin, the statue was subsequently displayed on the other oak, once again behind an iron grating, by order of Baron of Celles. In this new sanctuary the Mother of God was honored with the title of Our Lady of Faith. Those passing by did not fail to venerate the statue; and there were many unexpected healings. Graces of all kinds multiplied, and soon pilgrims began to flock to the area because of the dazzling miracles.</p><p>A priest of the Society of Jesus had recently been sent to Gravelines. He worked diligently to cultivate souls, as if upon a fruitful vine, and by his sermons excited the people of the region to a greater love for the Mother of God. Seeing that this devotion had taken root, he met with the local Magistrate to discuss how to maintain and increase the piety of the people. It was decided that they should make replicas of the statue of Our Lady of Faith, made from the wood of the first oak. When the first was completed, the image was observed to have a great resemblance to the original. Received with great joy, it was to be placed in a large reliquary above the high altar in the parish church.</p><p>The image of Mary, Our Lady of Faith (de Foy), was solemnly installed by the Bishop of St. Omer on the feast of the Ascension. Since the year 1622 she has been honored by huge gatherings of the faithful. Great numbers of miracles occurred \u200b\u200band still occur daily, says Father Boil, and he cites as support of his assertion a booklet entitled: Remarkable Healings made through \u200b\u200bthe invocation of Our Lady of Faith, Gravelines, which was a booklet printed at St. Omer in 1623, with the approval of the Bishop.</p><p>To satisfy the pious zeal of the faithful, the venerated image of Our Lady of Faith was frequently reproduced. The oak, which for so many years had contained the image, served this purpose, as its wood was used to create other similar statues of Our Lady of Foy. The additional statues of the Holy Virgin which were distributed to churches in Bailleul, Dilingue, Gravelines, Huy, Lille, Lobbes, Marchiennes Montmartre, Saint-Omer, Oudenbourg, Reims, Ruislip, an D'Furnes, among others. These cities were honored to possess this image of Mary, and welcomed the statue, made of the same wood of the tree of Foy. In all of these various localities Our Lady of Faith began to work many wonders.</p><p>Of all the images made of wood modeled after the original Madonna, the most famous perhaps is the one that is kept today at the cathedral of Amiens. The statue was placed in the church of the Augustinian religious at the beginning of the year 1629, whose monastery was located in the parish of Saint Michael. As of May 3 of that year wonderful miracles began to occurr, and soon the Bishop of Amiens, Francois Le Febvre de Caumartin, formed a commission to study and conduct the necessary investigations. He ended by canonically recognizing devotion to the image and published four major miracles which had occurred, including the most striking being the resurrection of a dead child.</p><p>Here are some details recalling this memorable prodigy. A child had fallen into a pit and been buried for several hours. The devout Christians who struggled to rescue him did all in their power to revive him, but to no avail. Finally, the people took the child before the statue of Our Lady of Foy and knelt to pray with confidence for Our Lady's intercession. Immediately the child showed signs of life and awakened as if from sleep.</p><p>At Gravelines, there had been a child who died at birth. While he was being prepared for his burial, the sorrowful mother invoked Mary in the image of Our Lady of Faith. Suddenly, a life-giving warmth spread through the child's icy members, who then began to cry and shake his small hands. The child received baptism, and now grows under the watchful eyes of his mother, for whom he is a constant consolation.</p><p>A ship captain related that his ship had recently sunk beneath the waves, and that the sailors and passengers aboard had all perished. The captain alone remained struggling against the swells, without hope of rescue, and recalled that he himself was near death. In his pressing moment of need he has recourse to Our Lady of Faith, and vowed to make a pilgrimage to the church if he should live. Although he was three leagues from Gravelines, he was instantly transported to the shore and hastened to fulfill his vow.</p><p>On another occasion, a father, whose child had died, came to Amiens carrying the lifeless body of his infant son. The child had been baptized out of necessity by the hands of his grandmother. The father arrived at the church of the convent during the celebration of Holy Mass. He set the child before the image of Our Lady of Faith, and the little corpse revived before the wondering eyes of the faithful during the Elevation.</p><p>The chaplain of the queen-mother, who was a former canon of the cathedral, split the press of people and inquired whether the child had been baptized. On the negative reply of the father, who falsely believed the grandmother's baptism had been invalid, the priest renewed the sacramental rite and gave the name of Augustine to the happy child of the Blessed Virgin. Sometime after the miracle, the child died again and was buried in the cemetery of Saint James. After thirteen days the body was exhumed, and there was no sign of any corruption.</p><p>During the plague of 1634 which ravaged Amiens, the people of the town processed with the image of Our Lady of Foy, and the bishop presided over the ceremony and celebrated the Pontifical Mass. The plague ceased.</p><p>In the year 1636 the noble ladies were frequently seen with their \u200b\u200bmaids of honor praying before the holy image, and Cardinal Richelieu who attend the litanies that were sung every day in this blessed sanctuary. In addition, the brotherhood, established under the title of Our Lady of Foy, included a number of high ranking personages, including King Louis XIII, Anne of Autriclhe, King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Therese, King Louis XV, as well as the members of the noblest and most illustrious families of Picardy. The religious association had chosen as its main feast the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin, a mystery that recalls so perfectly the incomparable faith of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p><p>All of these prodigies had an immense effect, and the number of extraordinary favors soon became considerable. The miraculous Madonna of Foy drew the faithful more than ever in all their necessities.</p><p>The image of Our Lady of Foy was hidden to protect it from the impious during the time of the French Revolution.</p><p>Afterwards, the image was returned to the church, but the little Madonna became lost in the vastness of the cathedral, and received the homage of only a few souls who knew and remembered.In 1878, Bishop Battle, of pious memory, celebrated Mass at Notre-Dame de Foy, and the restoration of this cult was finally decided. Soon the venerable Chapter, supported by the bishop, asked the Pope to deign to open the treasure of indulgences. Many devotions and pilgrimages were once again made in her honor, and candles were constantly kept burning before her image. Every 15thof August, the Feast of the Assumption, there again resumed public recitation of Litanies along with processions as the people showed their love and appreciation for their Heavenly Mother. Since then Our Lady of Faith constantly gathers new testimonies of love by her precious favors.</p><p>July 26 and 27 are Celebrated as the feast day of Our Lady of Faith.</p>"

    "Our Lady of Fatima": {
        "eng": "<p>Our Lady of Fatima, or in Portuguese Nossa Senhora de Fatima, refers to the Marian apparitions that occurred at Fatima, Portugal, in 1917. The first apparition occurred on May 13th, and the last occurred on October 13th with the miracle of the sun. In a world where Our Lady has appeared hundreds of times throughout the centuries and worked tens of thousands of miracles, what makes the apparitions at Fatima so extraordinary is the prophecy of a coming world war and the secrets that were entrusted to the children who spoke with the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p><p>The three children the Blessed Virgin appeared to were Lucia dos Santos, aged 10, and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto, aged 9 and 7. They were tending sheep in the Cova de Iria when they saw a woman \"brighter than the sun,\" who exhorted them to do penance.</p><p>The last apparition of Our Lady of Fatima occurred on October 13th, and there were about 70,000 people present for the event, among them atheists who did not believe the stories related by the children. It was a rainy day, and everyone was soaked and the earth was muddy and covered with murky puddles. The rain ceased at the beginning of the apparition, and at one point Lucia called out for everyone to look at the sun. Even the anti-Catholic paper Ordem later wrote:</p><p>\"\u2026the sun trembled, made sudden incredible movements outside all cosmic laws  -  the sun \u2018danced' according to the typical expression of the people.\"</p><p>It is almost comical that the unbelievers today will talk about \u2018mass hysteria' or attribute the miracle to merely being an illusion caused by staring at the sun. They conveniently omit from their theories the recorded fact that when the vision of the dancing sun ended the thousands of people who watched the vision and the ground they stood upon were all dry! So many in our day love to pretend that we are superior sophisticates, when the truth is that many are willfully blind, rejecting the Truth until the end rather than amending their lives. So be it.</p><p>The Blessed Virgin showed the children a vision of hell, and also told them:</p><p>\"You have seen hell where the souls of poor sinners go. To save them, God wishes to establish in the world devotion to my Immaculate Heart. If you I say is done, many souls will be saved and there will be peace. The war will end, but if men do not cease to offend God a worse one will break out during the Pontificate of Pope Pius XI. When you see a night illuminated by a bright and unfamiliar light, know that this is the great sign given you by God that He is about to punish humanity for its crimes by means of war, famine, and persecutions of the Church and the Holy Father. To prevent this, I shall come to ask for the consecration of Russia to my Immaculate Heart and the Communion of Reparation on the First Saturdays. If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted and there will be peace; if not, she will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church. The good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have much to suffer, and various nations will be annihilated. In the end, my Immaculate Heart will triumph. The Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me, and she shall be converted, and a period of peace will be granted to the world.\"</p><p>The children were also told that there would be a remarkable sign in the night sky that would precede a second world war. It occurred on January 25th, 1938 as bright lights taken for an aurora borealis that was seen all over the northern hemisphere, including Europe, the United States, and even North Africa. Lucia verified that it was the sign the Blessed Virgin had foretold, and indeed, Hitler invaded Austria within a few months.</p><p>The Church has found the apparitions to be worthy of belief, and millions of faithful Catholics have travelled as pilgrims to the shrine at Fatima. Francisco and his sister Jacinta died shortly after the apparitions, while Lucia later became a sister, dying at the convent in 2005 at the age of 97. As if to testify to the truthfulness of the apparitions she had related to the world, the body of Jacinta Marto was exhumed in 1935 and again in 1951, and was found to be incorrupt and surrounded by a pleasant odor on both occasions.</p>"

    "Our Lady of Fire": {
        "eng": "<p>The best-known print in early times was certainly the miraculous woodcut of Forli in northeastern Italy that became famous as Our Lady of Fire, or Our Lady of the Fire. It is the subject of the earliest monograph on a printed picture, which also fixes the earliest date that can be attached to a surviving Italian print. This book is Giuliano Bezzi's \"Il Fuoco Trionfante,\" printed in 1637 at Forli, between Florence and Ravenna, and he speaks of the incident remembered as Our Lady of Fire.</p><p>\"Around the year of our Lord 1420, in a pleasant house by the cathedral at Forli, the devout and learned Lombardino Brussi of Ripetrosa imitated Christ among the disciples at Emmaus by breaking the bread of the fear of the Lord and of humane letters with school boys. Their household devotion turned to the Virgin. They ever began and ended their literary exercises by praising and praying to this great sovereign of the universe. They said their prayers before an image of Our Lady rudely printed from a woodblock on a paper about a foot square. Printing was then new, and who knows if this may not have been the first print by the first printmaker? The simplicity of the image certainly matched the well-mannered scholar's simplicity of heart. It showed, and still shows, the most Blessed Virgin holding her Holy Infant and surrounded by saints like King Solomon by his guard. Above to the right and left shine the sun and the moon, luminously forecasting that the Virgin was to consecrate this paper with a power like the moon's over water and the sun's over fair weather.\"</p><p>\"The worship of the Virgin had advanced these happy boys from easy letters to graver studies when, on February 4, 1428, fire broke out in the downstairs classroom. Whether it started by accident or by design is not known, but certain it is that the outcome so glorified God and His Blessed Mother that fires nowadays cause joy where they burn! When this fire had feasted on the benches and cupboards of the school, it followed its nature to ascend and sprang at the sacred paper. In awe at the sight of the most holy image, the flames stopped and  -  wonder of wonders  -  like the blameless fingers of a loving hand, they detached it from the wall to which it was tacked. The fire thought the wall too base a support for so sublime a portrait and longed to uphold the heaven of that likeness, like the other heaven, on a blazing sphere. Above the flames raging in the closed room the unscorched image floated as on a throne. When the fire had consumed the ceiling beams it wafted out the revered leaf, not to burn but to exalt it. With this leaf on its back it flew to the second floor, to the third, to the roof, then through the roof, and behold, the Virgin's image burst above the wondrous pyre like a phoenix, triumphant and unconsumed! The miracle drew the eyes of all the populace and came to the ears of Monsignor Domenico Capranica, the papal legate, who carried the paper in a procession, accompanied by all the people, to the cathedral of Santa Croce, where it was placed in a holy but simple chapel.\"</p><p>The building burned to the ground, but the image of Our Lady of Fire was not forgotten. Copies were made of the image, and they could be found in every Christian home in the region. The original print itself was the focus and center of religious life in the town of Forli, which had been blessed to witness such a great miracle.</p>"

This shrine became a place of pilgrimage as a result of the miraculous cure of a child prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Margaret's. The little one, unseen by Margaret's coachman, had been seriously injured while playing about the stable-yard. The doctors pronounced her hopelessly lame for life.</p><p>Margaret, however, was confident in Our Lady's intercession, and took the child to the neighboring shrine every Saturday and begged the Mother of God to be merciful to the child as well as to the grieving parents. After the fifteenth visit, the little girl, with a happy cry, jumped from the arms of her mother. \"I can walk straight, see?\" and proved that Our Lady had indeed cured her in that instant.</p><p>When Margaret de Dampiere died in 1280, she was buried in the middle of the choir.</p><p>The renown of the shrine continued to spread over time, and many pilgrimages to Our Lady of Flines was the result.

    "Our Lady of Fourviere": {
        "eng": "<p>According to the traditions of Lyons, supported by a bull of Innocent IV., Saint Pothinus erected the first oratory where Mary was invoked in Gaul. It is asserted that he brought from the interior of Asia a small statue of the Blessed Virgin, which he deposited in a solitary and shaded crypt on the banks of the Saone, in front of the hill of Fourviere. He set up in this wild and secluded spot an altar to the true God, and placed there the image, which was transferred later on to a temple built on the hill itself, whence it took the name of Our Lady of Fourviere.</p><p>The veneration of the people, in the middle ages, surrounded this church, and it was a pilgrimage of great renown throughout the Lyonnais; but the Calvinists, who destroyed and pillaged so many rich sanctuaries, showed no favor to that of Lyons; the church of Fourviere, where, from the birth of Christianity, each generation had marked its passage by gifts to Our Lady of Fourviere, which would be at this day as precious to the antiquary, the sculptor, and the painter, as to the pilgrim, retained nothing but its four bare walls, which could not be melted down in the crucible, where so many master productions disappeared, which had the misfortune to be made of gold or silver.</p><p>The chapter of Saint John could not attend to the renovation of that of Fourviere, till long after the ravages of the Protestants. They worked at it after they had restored the cathedral and the cloister. The altar of Mary, Our Lady of Fourviere, was at last consecrated on the 21st of August, 1586. From that moment the confidence of the inhabitants turned towards that beacon of salvation. \"The source of prodigies seemed dried up there,\" says an ancient historian; \"they began again at the end of the sixteenth century, and all Lyons felt great joy on the occasion.\"</p><p>During the revolution of 1793, the church of Fourviere was sold; but when calm was restored, the zealous prelate who governed the ancient church of Pothinus and Irenaeus procured the sanctuary of Mary to be restored to the veneration of her as Our Lady of Fourviere. The inauguration of it was performed on the 19th of April, 1805, by the sovereign pontiff Pius VII. In 1832 and 1835, Lyons being threatened with cholera, lifted up her eyes to the holy mountain, and the Blessed Virgin said to the scourge, \"Thou shalt go no farther.\" The capital of the Lyonnese, respected against every attempt, changed its cries of alarm into canticles of joy, and the prayers of thanksgiving were solemnly and justly offered to Mary in her protecting sanctuary.</p><p>Ever since the happy period when that sanctuary was restored to religious worship, piety seems to have redoubled its ardor for Our Blessed Lady, and it is at Fourviere that it is sharpened and revived. The inhabitants of Lyons, and those of the county adjacent, throng the paths of the hill of Mary; at whatever hour you repair thither, you always find yourself in the midst of a crowd of pious persons of all ranks, ages, and conditions.</p><p>One day, in the year 1815, a pilgrim of an unusual kind, who had begun by observing Lyons from the summit of the hill, like a man who wanted to study both its strength and its weakness, presented himself in the church of Notre Dame; and the faithful, lifting up for a moment their eyes, which had been cast down in prayer, said to themselves, \"Marshal Suchet!\"</p><p>It was indeed he  -  the marshal of the empire, the child of Lyons, to whom was confided the defense of his native city  -  who passed along the nave of the church of Mary with a slow step, with a respectful countenance, in which was mingled something mild and softened, something like a distant remembrance of joy, which awakens and soothes the soul with an invisible music. He goes into the sacristy, and directs one of the chaplains to come to him there; the vice-president hastens to him: \"Monsieur l'Abbe,\" says the marshal, stepping forward towards the ecclesiastic, \"when I was quite a child, my pious and good mother often brought me here, to the feet of Our Lady, and this I still remember\u2026I will say more, this recollection is dear to me, and I have never lost it. Be pleased to have some masses said for my intention.\" And putting down three Napoleons on the table where the offerings are registered, the brilliant hero of the gigantic epoch went to kneel, quite unpretendingly, before the altar of Mary, where he prayed for some time with edifying devotion. Moreover, Marshal Suchet terminated his noble and loyal career by a Christian end, for which he was praised upon his tomb.</p>"

It towers almost 2,500 feet above sea level.</p><p>On the very top of this huge pedestal, there is an enormous metal statue of the Blessed Virgin and Child, erected in 1860. It is the second largest statue in the world, second only to the Statue of Liberty, which was also made in France. The figure of the virgin, approximately fifty-five feet high, stands upon a globe; above her head is a starry crown, her feet crush a serpent. The Infant sits on her right arm, His right hand raised in blessing of the entire countryside.</p><p>The project to build the statue was actually initiated in 1847 with the desire to construct a religious monument to recognize the area of Puy-en-Velay. In order to find a worthy model of the Blessed Virgin and her Divine Son, a competition was held having very specific requirements, such as \"the Child Jesus is to be depicted blessing the city of Puy without hiding the face of His Mother.\" In all, 55 artists participated, and the winning model selected at the end of the competition was the statue submitted by J. Bonnassieux.</p><p>Donations to pay for the construction were collected from all over France.

He was a great warrior and leader of the people of Albania who fought against the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into his kingdom. An invincible opponent of Islam, the reason for his successes was no secret: he \"loved the sanctuary of Mary with a devoted, enthusiastic love; and Mary in return, not only made him a model of Christian perfection, but also gave him an invincible power, which preserved not only Albania but also Christendom during his reign.\"</p><p>There was at this time a miraculous painting located in the town of Scutari, which was the capital of Albania. Our Lady of Scutari, now known as Our Lady of Good Counsel and Our Lady of Genazzano, is an image of Our Lady holding her Divine Son which had been painted on a thin sheet of plaster by an unknown hand. This portrait, reputed to date from the time of the Apostles of Christ, was greatly venerated and beloved by the faithful Albanian people. It was Our Lady of Scutari who had consoled and preserved Iskander through all his trials.</p><p>After his victories, Iskander went to kneel before the image of Our Lady of Scutari, thanking and publicly praising her for his success. \"He was a hero formed in the same school as all those who derive their strength from their devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Like a new Saint Fernando III, King of Castile, Scanderbeg was, under the guidance of Mary, as gentle in peace as he was terrible in war. The good Christian prince was often seen at her feet to beg the protection of his Lady in his greatest afflictions.\"</p><p>Pope Nicholas V called Iskander \"the champion and shield of Christendom,\" which was true, although it was the Blessed Virgin Mary who protected her champion and granted him his victories. The prince and unvanquished warrior, whose strength of soul gave his compatriots fortitude to throw off their lethargy, courage to rise up against the oppressive infidels, daring to despise death and thus expel them from their country, moved his subjects not only by example but also by his unbreakable faith, his ardent charity, and his unshakable hope. Scanderbeg was God's sword against the enemies of the holy Catholic Faith, the impregnable defensive wall protecting his realm.</p><p>At the end of his life, physically exhausted from his labors, Iskander sensed that his death was near. He went one last time to visit Our Lady of Scutari at her shrine, and then retired to the city of Lesh to die. There he won a final battle against the Turks before he laid down and gave up his soul to God. He had ended his life heroically as a powerful defender of the Catholic faith and of Christendom.</p><p>Shortly after Iskander's death, the Ottoman army invaded Albania again. Without their invincible champion, it was only a matter of time before the capital was taken. The Blessed Virgin revealed to two pious men that her image would not be desecrated, and told them to prepare themselves for a long journey to follow the fresco when it left Albania. The picture then moved away from the wall, seemingly of its own accord, and floated into the air.</p><p>As the pair followed the image of Jesus and Mary, it was hidden in a cloud and went out over the waters of the Adriatic sea. Full of confidence in Our Lady, the men stepped upon the water, which miraculously supported them, and so they continued to follow the image until they made land along the coast of Italy. At that point they lost sight of the cloud.</p><p>It was not long before they learned where the image had gone. The cloud was seen again by the people of Genazzano when they looked up into the sky to find the source of the heavenly music that suddenly reached their ears. They watched dumbfounded as the little cloud descended and came to rest where it can still be seen today, floating before a wall of the Church of the Mother of Good Counsel in Genazzano. The image indeed floats before the wall, for it is not attached or supported in any way.</p><p>A hundred years later Pope Paul III had the picture studied and authenticated; Innocent IX had it crowned; many other Popes have granted favors to the shrine. As late as 1936 a commission formed to study the picture, reported, if struck a slight blow it reacts as if it were hollow; if set in motion, it oscillates visibly. Pope Leo XIII raised the sanctuary to the dignity of a basilica and had the invocation, \"Mother of Good Counsel\" added to the Litany of Loretto. Pope Pius IX had a great devotion to Our Lady under this title; he offered his first Mass before its image; in 1864 he made a pilgrimage to Genazzano to have counsel of her who is \"Seat of Wisdom.\" He kept her image in his study and fostered a cult to Mary under this title; thus he exemplified the filial confidence of all true sons of Mary.</p><p>There have been numerous miracles at the shrine where Mary took refuge after the death of her champion in Albania. Through this image of Our Lady of Genazzano, and throughout many long ages, she has been caring for her children on earth. As the Mother of God she has the ability to truly help us. Indeed, it is her ardent desire to support us and counsel us in our need. Pope Leo XIII instructed us to \"follow her counsels!\" and, like so many saints and Catholic heroes, we would profit greatly if we did so!</p>"

Petruccia is Petruccia de Nocera, and she was a Third Order Augustinian intent on restoring a church under the care of the hermits of Saint Augustine.</p><p>Petruccia had been left with a good deal of money after the death of her husband in the year 1436, and decided to use it to restore the church where she spent much of her time in prayer. She did not have enough money to complete the work, but she trusted that others would come forward to finish what was left when her money ran out.</p><p>A grand new church was begun, but Petruccia ran out of funds after only the first part of the construction had begun.

She would patiently answer them:</p><p>\"My dear children, do not put too much importance on this apparent misfortune. I assure you that before my death the Blessed Virgin and our holy father Augustine will finish the church begun by me.\"</p><p>Petruccia was not wrong. On the 25th of April, 1467, in the middle of the afternoon, a crowd began to gather in front of the unfinished church of Our Mother of Good Counsel when the chords of a beautiful melody could be heard, a melody that seemed to come from a luminous cloud that came down upon the church. The cloud stopped against one wall of the church when the bells of the church began to ring by themselves, as well as all of the bells located anywhere around the town.</p><p>When the little cloud dissipated, a beautiful image was revealed to the faithful, a painting of Our Lady tenderly holding her Divine Son in her arms. The painting was hovering in the air, and although it did not move, it was not attached to the wall. It remains that way to this day. Miracles and wonders began to occur before the image of the Virgin Mary.</p><p>The fame of the miraculous cures spread far and wide, attracting crowds of pilgrims.

She it was who is mentioned in the New Testament waiting on Jesus \"troubled about many things.\" According to the Golden Legend, after Jesus' death and resurrection, she left Judea with her brother and sister \"in a ship without sail, oars, or rudder.\" This occurred in about the year 48 AD.</p><p>Their boat was conducted on its way by Our Lord from heaven. Martha went first to the territory of Aquenese or Aix, a region now known as Provence, France. After converting the people to the True Faith, she and her siblings then travelled on to settle in Avignon.</p><p>There is a tradition that attributes the foundation of the church of Our Lady of Gifts, or \"Our Lady of Doms,\" at Avignon, to Saint Martha, and this while Our Lady was still alive! This church was built over what remained of a pagan temple atop a hill called \"Le Rocher des Doms.\" It is reported that this church was visibly consecrated by Our Lord Himself. Later in history the church was demolished by the Saracens, and was repaired by the Emperor Charlemagne.</p><p>The Golden Legend also details another event involving Martha.</p><p>\"There was at that time upon the river of Rhone, in a certain wood between Arles and Avignon, a great dragon, half beast and half fish, greater than an ox, longer than a horse, having teeth sharp as a sword, and horned on either side; head like a lion, tail like a serpent, and defended him with two wings on either side, and could not be beaten with cast of stones nor with other armor, and was as strong as twelve lions or bears; which dragon lay hiding and lurking in the river, and perished them that passed by and drowned ships. He came thither by sea from Galicia, and was engendered of Leviathan, which is a serpent of the water and is much wood, and of a beast called Bonacho, that is engendered in Galicia. To him Martha, at the prayer of the people, came into the wood, and found him eating a man. And she cast on him holy water, and showed to him the cross, which anon was overcome, and standing still as a sheep, she bound him with her own girdle, and then was slain with spears and glaives of the people.\"</p><p>Also known as Avignon Cathedral, and the Cathedrale Notre-Dame des Doms d'Avignon in French, the church at the present location was constructed in the 12th century in the Romanesque style. The seat of the Archbishop of Avignon, it is also a national monument in France. Atop the western tower is the large gilded statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary shown above.</p>"

On the hallowed spot where the first Holy Mass was celebrated, the shrine of Our Lady was built. A bright, smiling statue of the Virgin, nursing the Infant, named La Leche (the milk) statue.</p><p>England wanted Spanish Florida and in 1765 it became her colony  -  a political pawn. Twenty years later England returned Florida to Spain. During these years the Spanish had sought refuge in Cuba, taking with them all religious articles and treasures. The Statue was taken aboard a refugee ship, which disappeared on the sea. Returning to Florida in 1783, the Spaniards prayed for their statue to be returned. In 1822 Spain sold Florida to the United States, and in 1875 the Church bought the site of the shrine. Raids, massacres and land disputes did not lessen the devotion paid the Mother of God. Their shrine was gone; their beautiful statue lost at sea. Still, Catholic mothers paid tribute to Mary. For two centuries the search for the statue continued. In 1938 Artist John Duer was commissioned to do a second copy from the original statue in Madrid, Spain. The La Leche chapel also contains the remains of Admiral Menendez, founder of Saint Augustine.</p><p>Every year on Low Sunday there is a solemn pilgrimage to the shrine and the statue is carried in procession. More and more mothers and fathers from every state in the union are joining the pilgrimage each year. They know the need of more fervent devotion to the Blessed Mother. La Leche spans time  -  from the era of faith in God and the love of motherhood to our modern era of indifference to God and the collapse of families. Those who take part in this devotion express their belief in God as the Giver of Life and openly rebuke the organizations advocating birth control. They are fearlessly protesting against self-styled leaders who trample the ideals of family life.</p><p>Today's mothers must beg intercession from Our Mother Mary for the preservation of the Christian family. They mush model their home life after that of the Holy Family.</p><p>Not only will the Virgin of La Leche help those who turn to her in pregnancy; she is anxious to aid all families, who desire to preserve the glorious ideas of a truly Christian home. Mary is the Mother of us all, and she will not refuse any favor, of whatever nature it might be; she will give us the milk of her loving kindness in every need, just for the asking.</p>"

The shrine features a basilica church where there are Masses and lay preaching, and two other statues of the virgin and child in the outdoor arcades.</p><p>Worshipers at the shrine include as many Hindus as Catholics, in part because Hindus tend to be comfortable drawing non-Hindu religious figures into their worship life. In interviews at the shrine, visitors said that they came for peace, and to pray for prosperity for themselves and for all. They refer to Mary especially as Mother Mary.

The Archbishop himself cleaned the board further and as he worked, the features of the Mother and Child became clearer and more distinct.

The statue was first set up in a temporary chapel in one of the rooms of Montezuma's palace where the Spanish officers made their devotions. On the terrible night when the Indians rose against the Spanish conquerors, one of the officers rescued the statue before fighting his way out of the palace. He did not get far out when he was cut down by Aztec arrows and died at the foot of the Maguey tree. The tiny statue was either pushed or it fell into the roots of the tree where it was overlooked by the Indians.</p><p>Some twenty years later, and Aztec convert prince, John the Eagle, was walking near the tree when he heard a sweet voice calling him; puzzled, he went to the nearby mission of the Franciscan Fathers and told them about it. They thought it was his imagination. Some days later John met with an accident, a large pillar of a church under construction fell on him; badly crushed, he was given the Last Sacraments. During the night when he was thought to be dying, the memory of the sweet voice kept returning to him. He prayed to Our Lady to help him; very early in the morning she gave him a sash to wear and cured him. A few days later he passed the tree again, and heard the sweet voice; curiously, he looked carefully around the roots of the tree; half buried in the sand, he found the tiny statue of Our Lady.</p><p>The Aztec convert thought he should do something about it. \"Come home with me, gracious Lady,\" he said, \"I will see that you have a good home and are cared for;\" he brought the little statue home wrapped in his cape and placed it on a rude altar.</p><p>Here Mary reigned as queen in the humble home for ten or twelve years; John kept the little shrine supplied with flowers, and occasionally with fruit and pretty stones. Gradually people came to pray at the shrine, their number increasing so, they were under foot day and night. John took up the local school-master's suggestion to build a little chapel; he set about building a shrine and enthroned Mary, Our Lady of Good Remedies, there.</p><p>The next day to his horror, she was gone. Lonely and sorrowful, John went to the Maguey tree where he had first found her - and there she was! He returned the statue to the new shrine and decorated it carefully but she disappeared again; just when John became ill with fever, which is often fatal in this land. John's relatives hurried to carry him to Our Lady's feet in Guadaloupe; as he lay gasping before the shrine of Our Lady of Good Remedies he heard the same sweet voice say: \"Why do you come to my house when you put me out of yours?\"</p><p>John apologized and she continued, \"If you did not want me in your house, why not take me back to the Maguey tree and build me a chapel there?\"</p><p>\"If you cure me, Lady, I most certainly will,\" promised the sick man. He was cured by Our Lady of Good Remedies, and he was as good as his word. He built a chapel into a hermitage and spent the rest of his life there.</p><p>Years later, after John's death, the shrine fell into ruins. In 1574 the Spanish governor happened to see the ruins and was told the story. He ordered the building of a beautiful church to house the statue.

        "eng": "<p>The Convent of the Immaculate Conception was the first convent of Religious Sisters in the city of Quito, Ecuador. The Catholic nobility of the city of Quito petitioned King Philip II for this favor, so that the women of the colony might enjoy the benefits of the religious life. Five professed Sisters of the Order were sent from Spain as Founding Mothers of the new Convent. They were accompanied by a 13-year old girl, Mariana de Jes\u00fas Torres - the niece of the Mother Superior. She was to become the most well-known of the Founding Mothers, but she remained almost unknown outside of Ecuador until the 20th century. The Convent was formally founded on January 13, 1577.</p><p>The young novice made rapid advancement in the spiritual life and enjoyed many favors from Heaven. She also practiced severe penance and was chosen by God to suffer as a victim soul. Many of her sufferings were occasioned by those of her sisters in religion who were lax, and who rebelled against the austere way of life insisted upon by Blessed Beatriz de Silva and the Spanish Founding Mothers, and required by the Holy Rule of the Community. Eventually Madre Mariana was chosen to be Abbess in place of her ailing aunt, who died soon after.</p><p><b>First Apparition of Our Lady of Good Success</b></p><p>Very early on the morning of February 2, 1594, Mother Mariana was praying in the upper choir of the Convent, fervently beseeching Jesus and Mary for relief from the many severe trials the Convent was undergoing, and that many sins would be prevented. During her long prayer, she heard a sweet voice call her name. Rising quickly, she saw the Blessed Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in Her left arm. Being asked who She was, Our Lady replied:</p><p>\"I am Mary of Good Success, the Queen of Heaven and Earth... As His Mother, I carry (the Child Jesus) here, in My left arm, so that together we might restrain the hand of Divine Justice, which is always so ready to chastise this unfortunate and criminal world.</p><p>\"In My right hand, I carry the crosier that you see, for I desire to govern this Convent as Abbess and Mother... Satan will begin to try to destroy this work of God... But he will not succeed, because I am the Queen of Victories and the Mother of Good Success, and it is under this invocation I desire to be known throughout all time...\"</p><p>The Most Holy Virgin Mary placed the Child Jesus in the arms of Mother Mariana, giving her a strong desire to suffer as a victim soul.</p><p><b>Our Lady Commands that a Statue Be Made</b></p><p>Our Lady appeared many more times to Mother Mariana. During the apparition of January 16, 1599, Our Lady commanded Madre Mariana to have a statue made depicting Her just as She appeared to the holy religious. She then bade her to measure Her height with the cord of her religious habit. Our Lady promised:</p><p>\"When tribulations of spirit and sufferings of body oppress them and they seem to be drowning in a bottomless sea, let them gaze at My holy Image, which will be for them a star for the shipwrecked. I will always be there, ready to listen to their lamentations and calm their weeping. Tell them that they should always have recourse to their Mother with faith and love...\"</p><p><b>Warnings About the 20th Century</b></p><p>Early in the morning of January 21, 1610, Mother Mariana was favored by an apparition of the Archangels St. Michael, St. Gabriel and St. Raphael. Then Our Lady appeared and related many predictions:</p><p>\"Thus I make it known to you that from the end of the 19th century and shortly after the middle of the 20th century, in what is today the Colony and will then be the Republic of Ecuador, the passions will erupt and there will be a total corruption of customs (morals), for Satan will reign almost completely by means of the Masonic sects.</p><p>\"They will focus principally on the children in order to sustain this general corruption. Woe to the children of these times! It will be difficult to receive the Sacrament of Baptism, and also that of Confirmation... Often during this epoch the enemies of Jesus Christ, instigated by the Devil, will steal consecrated hosts from the churches, so that they might profane the Eucharistic Species...</p><p>\"As for the Sacrament of Matrimony... it will be attacked and deeply profaned... The Catholic spirit will rapidly decay; the precious light of the Faith will gradually be extinguished... Added to this will be the effects of secular education, which will be one reason for the dearth of priestly and religious vocations.</p><p>\"The Sacrament of Holy Orders will be ridiculed, oppressed, and despised... The Devil will try to persecute the ministers of the Lord in every possible way; he will labor with cruel and subtle astuteness to deviate them from the spirit of their vocation and will corrupt many of them. These depraved priests, who will scandalize the Christian people, will make the hatred of bad Catholics and the enemies of the Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church fall upon all priests...</p><p>\"Further, in these unhappy times, there will be unbridled luxury, which will ensnare the rest into sin and conquer innumerable frivolous souls, who will be lost. Innocence will almost no longer be found in children, nor modesty in women. In this supreme moment of need of the Church, the one who should speak will fall silent.\"</p><p><b>The Apparitions Will Become Known in the 20th Century</b></p><p>Early on the morning of February 2, 1610, Our Lady appeared again to Mother Mariana and repeated her command to have a statue made. Then She added:</p><p>\"Tell the Bishop that it is My will and the will of My Most Holy Son that your name be hidden at all costs... for it is not fitting for anyone at the present time to know the details or origin of how this Statue came to be made. For this knowledge will only become known to the general public in the 20th century.</p><p>\"During that epoch the Church will find herself attacked by terrible hordes of the Masonic sect, and this poor Ecuadorian land will be agonizing because of the corruption of customs, unbridled luxury, the impious press, and secular education. The vices of impurity, blasphemy, and sacrilege will dominate in this time of depraved desolation, and that one who should speak out will be silent...\"</p><p><b>The Statue is Finished by Angels</b></p><p>The sculptor of the Statue of Our Lady of Good Success was actually named for this work by Our Lady Herself. Nevertheless the work was predicted to be completed by the Angels. Mother Mariana witnessed this prodigy early in the morning of January 16, 1611. She saw in vision the Most Holy Trinity, the Most Holy Virgin Mary, the Nine Choirs of Angels, and in particular the Archangels St. Michael, St. Gabriel and St. Raphael, together with the Seraphic St. Francis. These last four approached the statue and finished the work which the sculptor had intended to finish that very day. Then she saw Our Lady enter into and animate the Statue. All of these facts were attested to by Mother Mariana to the Bishop, before he solemnly consecrated and installed the Statue. The sculptor, too, testified that he had not finished the Statue, and that it must be the work of Angels.</p><p><b>Five Prophecies for Our Times</b></p><p>The most important of the apparitions of Our Lady of Good Success took place near the end of Mother Mariana's life. The early morning of February 2, 1634, the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, found Mother Mariana praying before the Blessed Sacrament, beseeching Him that she might be united with Him and be engulfed in that love which belongs to the Blessed. She also reminded Him to protect and preserve His daughters in this beloved Convent.</p><p>As she finished this prayer, she saw the sanctuary light extinguish itself, leaving the altar completely dark. Our Lady appeared to tell her that Our Lord had heard her clamors and would end her earthly exile in less than a year: \"Prepare your soul so that, increasingly purified, it might enter into the fullness of the joy of Our Lord. Oh! if mortals, and in particular religious souls, could know what Heaven is and what it is to possess God! How differently they would live! Nor would they spare themselves any sacrifice in order to possess Him!\"</p><p>The Blessed Virgin Mary then explained the five meanings of the Tabernacle light that had been extinguished before Mother Mariana's eyes.</p><p>I.\"The first significance is that at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, various heresies will be propagated in this land, then a free Republic. As these heresies spread and dominate, the precious light of Faith will be extinguished in souls by the almost total corruption of customs (morals). During this period, there will be great physical and moral calamities, both public and private.</p><p>\"The small number of souls who, hidden, will preserve the treasure of the Faith and the virtues will suffer an unspeakably cruel and prolonged martyrdom. Many of them will succumb to death from the violence of their sufferings, and those who sacrifice themselves for Church and Country will be counted as martyrs.</p><p>\"In order to free men from bondage to these heresies, those whom the merciful love of My Most Holy Son will destine for that restoration will need great strength of will, constancy, valor and much confidence in God. To test this faith and confidence of the just, there will be occasions when everything will seem to be lost and paralyzed. This, then, will be the happy beginning of the complete restoration.\"</p><p>These chosen souls, who will restore the health of the Church, are described in detail as the apostles of the latter times, by St. Louis Marie de Montfort in his True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p><p>II.\"The second meaning,\" Our Lady said, \"is that My Convent, being greatly reduced in size, will be submerged in a fathomless ocean of indescribable bitterness, and will seem to be drowning in these diverse waters of tribulations.\" Many authentic vocations will perish, She continued. Injustice would enter even this Convent, \"disguised under the name of false charity, wreaking havoc in souls.\" And faithful souls, weeping in secret and imploring that such dire times be shortened, would suffer a continuous and slow martyrdom.</p><p>III.\"The third reason the lamp was extinguished is because of the spirit of impurity that will saturate the atmosphere in those times. Like a filthy ocean, it will run through the streets, squares and public places with an astonishing liberty.</p><p>\"There will be almost no virgin souls in the world,\" Our Lady told her. The delicate flower of virginity would be threatened by complete annihilation. However, She promised that there would always be some good souls in cloisters where it might take root, grow and live like a shield to deflect Divine Wrath. \"Without virginity,\" She said, \"it would be necessary for fire from Heaven to fall upon these lands to purify them.\"</p><p>IV.The fourth reason for the lamp being quenched is that the Masonic sects, having infiltrated all the social classes, would subtly introduce its teaching into domestic ambiences in order to corrupt the children, and the Devil would glory in dining upon the exquisite delicacy of the hearts of children.</p><p>\"During these unfortunate times,\" Our Lady foretold, \"evil will assault childhood innocence. In this way, vocations to the priesthood will be lost, which will be a true calamity.\"</p><p>Again Our Lady promised that during this time there would still be religious communities who will sustain the Church and holy ministers of the altar - hidden and beautiful souls, who will labor with valor and disinterested zeal for the salvation of souls. \"Against them,\" She warned, \"the impious will rage a cruel war, letting fall on them vituperations, calumnies and vexations in order to impede the fulfillment of their ministry. But they, like firm columns, will remain unswerving and will confront everything with the spirit of humility and sacrifice with which they will be vested, by virtue of the infinite merits of My Most Holy Son, Who will love them in the innermost fibers of His Most Holy and Tender Heart.\"</p><p>During this time, Our Lady foretold, \"the secular clergy will be far removed from its ideal, because the priests will become careless in their sacred duties. Lacking the Divine compass, they will stray from the road traced by God for the priestly ministry and they will become attached to wealth and riches, which they will unduly strive to obtain.</p><p>\"How the Church will suffer on that occasion - the dark night of the lack of a Prelate and Father to watch over them with paternal love, gentleness, strength, discernment and prudence. Many priests will lose their spirit, placing their souls in great danger.\"</p><p>Our Lady continued to explain the fourth reason for the extinguishing of the Tabernacle light: \"Therefore, pray insistently without tiring and weep with bitter tears in the secrecy of your heart. Implore our Celestial Father that, for the love of the Eucharistic Heart of My Most Holy Son and His Precious Blood shed with such generosity... He might take pity on His ministers and bring to an end those ominous times, and send to the Church the Prelate who will restore the spirit of Her priests.</p><p>\"My Most Holy Son and I will love this favored Son with a love of predilection, and We will gift Him with a rare capacity, humility of heart, docility to Divine inspiration, the strength to defend the rights of the Church, and a tender and compassionate heart, so that, like another Christ, He will assist the great and small, without despising the more unfortunate souls who ask Him for light and counsel in their doubts and hardships. Into His hands the scales of the Sanctuary will be placed, so that everything is weighed with due measure and God will be glorified.\"</p><p>Our Lady continued, \"The lukewarmness of all the souls consecrated to God in the priestly and religious state will delay the coming of this Prelate and Father. This, then, will be the cause of the cursed Devil taking possession of this land, where he will achieve his victories by means of a foreign and faithless people, so numerous that, like a black cloud, it will obscure the pure heavens of the then Republic consecrated to the Sacred Heart of My Divine Son.</p><p>\"With these people, all the vices will enter, which will attract in their turn every type of chastisement, such as plagues, famines, internal fighting and external disputes with other nations, and apostasy, the cause of the perdition of so many souls so dear to Jesus Christ and to Me.</p><p>\"In order to dissipate this black cloud which prevents the Church from enjoying the clear day of liberty, there will be a formidable and frightful war, which will see the bloodshed of countrymen and foreigners, of secular and regular priests, and of religious. That night will be most horrible, for, humanly speaking, evil will seem to triumph.</p><p>\"This, then, will mark the arrival of My hour, when I, in a marvelous way will dethrone the proud and cursed Satan, trampling him under My feet and fettering him in the infernal abyss. Thus the Church and Country will finally be free of his cruel tyranny.\"</p><p>V.The fifth reason that the lamp was extinguished is due to the laxity and the negligence of those who possess great wealth, who will indifferently stand by and watch the Church being oppressed, virtue being persecuted, and the triumph of the Devil, without piously employing their riches for the destruction of this evil and the restoration of the Faith. And it is also due to the indifference of the people in allowing the Name of God to be gradually extinguished and in adhering to the spirit of evil, freely delivering themselves over to vices and passions.</p><p>\"Alas! My chosen daughter! If it were given to you to live in that tenebrous era, you would die of sorrow to see all that I have revealed to you here take place. But My Most Holy Son and I have such a great love for this land, Our legacy, that We desire even now the application of your sacrifices and prayers to shorten the duration of such a terrible catastrophe!\"</p><p>Overwhelmed by the magnitude of the evils she saw and the countless souls that would be condemned during these times, Mother Mariana fell unconscious. There the Sisters found her, as if dead, except for the violent beating of her heart. All of the doctor's efforts to restore her to consciousness proved useless. In fact he said, humanly speaking, her life should have ended from the shock she had received.</p><p>The Sisters surrounded her, beseeching Heaven to leave them their great treasure, the last of the Founding Mothers, \"the mainstay of observance, the column of the house.\" Two days later, Mother Mariana opened her eyes, encouraged her Sisters to continue to follow the Rule, and consoled them that she would remain with them yet a little longer.</p><p><b>Final Apparition of Our Lady of Good Success</b></p><p>In the last ten months of her life, Mother Mariana never fully recovered the vigor of her health and was often obliged to remain in bed. In sickness as well as in health, she edified the Community with her example. Amid her intense pains, she always maintained a smile on her lips, an admirable serenity and an imperturbable spirit, proper to a soul whose life had unfolded in the shadow of the Cross.</p><p>Late in the night of December 8, 1634, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Our Lady appeared for the last time to Mother Mariana. She was again accompanied by the Archangels St. Michael, St. Gabriel and St. Raphael. After many revelations Our Lady concluded:</p><p>\"In the 20th century, this devotion (to Our Lady of Good Success) will work prodigies in the spiritual as well as temporal spheres, because it is the Will of God to reserve this invocation and knowledge of your life for that century, when the corruption of customs will be almost general and the precious light of Faith all but extinguished...\"</p><p>Madre Mariana de Jes\u00fas Torres died a most holy death at 3:00 p.m. on January 16, 1635 - just as she had foretold.</p><p>Over and over during the last four hundred years, the prophecies of Our Lady of Good Success have been fulfilled. The 19th and 20th centuries proved the accuracy of the prophecies to be astounding. Clearly the significance of Our Lady's message, and the Devotion to Our Lady of Good Success, is now all the more important in the 21st century. As we see the world engulfed in error, heresy and sensuality, not to mention vices of all kinds, Our Lady's call to prayer, reparation and penance becomes all the more urgent. How can we not heed Our Lady's plea and daily strive to console Her Most Tender and Immaculate Heart and the Sacred Heart of Her Divine Son?</p>"

        "eng": "<p>It was on December 23rd, 1563, when the bishop of Lucon, Jean-Baptiste Tiercelin, consecrated the church under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin, Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle. This first chapel came into the world in the midst of religious convulsions that were then taking place in Switzerland, Germany, and England by the leaders of the \u2018Reformation,' and must necessarily be seen as an action bravely going against the tide. The religious wars that began raging in France ten years after its erection began to be another reason for some concern for faithful Catholics, but the pilgrimages to the church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle continued undisturbed. From time immemorial there had been venerated at Notre Dame a statue of the Blessed Virgin, holding in her arm the Infant Jesus. Many went to her in procession, especially children, who came each year to ask Mary for perseverance after their first communion.</p><p>The revolutionary turmoil in France, which was to take the throne and the altar, could not leave behind the parish of Our Lady of Good Tidings. In 1790 the National Assembly decreed a new law in which the church of Our Lady of Good Tidings was dissolved. As the pastor, M. Fabre, had the courage to refuse the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, he was thrown into the street.</p><p>A short time later, on May 22, 1791, the abbot Fourquet de Damalis, convened in the church an assembly of the faithful, and there were very many who responded. This occurred under the noses of twelve national guardsmen, and so the Police Commissioner, a man named Cafin, responded there quickly. He asked the abbot why there was such a meeting, and the abbot answered him that he was explaining to the faithful the decrees of the National Assembly for the public good. The Police Commissioner accepted the explanation, and the meeting having been perfectly peaceful, the police commissioner was obliged to agree to the monthly meetings and record it in his minutes.</p><p>One might think that the worship would be suspended at Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle during the Terror, but we have evidence to the contrary. As at Chartres, a great number of the faithful remained active and opposed the removal of the sacred ornaments of the church and defended their priests, and eager to fulfill their religious duties, they were not to be intimidated by the fear of imprisonment and even death. From the registry of marriages and baptisms, including a few that date back to 1793, we know that there were religious ceremonies such as baptisms and weddings held there secretly, sometimes in an oratory, sometimes in the church.</p><p>In the year 1818 a severe epidemic was ravaging the country. The faithful vowed, with the agreement of their bishop, to go in procession to Our Lady of Good Tidings and celebrate in perpetuity the feast of the Visitation, which was the feast of the chapel. The procession took place, and God quickly put an end to the scourge of the plague.</p><p>At about that time, a young boy began making regular visits to the church of Our Lady of Good Tidings, who was the patroness of the village. He was a poor boy materially, for Lempdes was one of the poorer villages in France, and he had been born into a peasant family that was struggling to eke out a living in the wreck of post-revolutionary France. He kept the faith, and when he grew up Jean Baptiste Lamy was ordained a priest, eventually becoming the first Archbishop of Sana Fe, New Mexico.</p>"

The Royal Abbey of Saint Victor was paid for by King Louis VI, but it was William of Champeaux, the archdeacon of Notre-Dame in Paris, who unintentionally began the Abbey dedicated to Saint Victor in 1113.</p><p>It seems William was famous for the lectures he gave to great crowds of his eager students, but he eventually decided to leave all to become a hermit. He relinquished his chair, thinking to retire to a small hermitage dedicated to Saint Victor near Paris. Due to his fame, however, he was followed by many men who wished to become his disciples and learn ever more from him. Thus, William was unexpectedly forced to once again become a teacher to his own community.</p><p>This was the origin of what became known as the Royal Abbey School of Saint Victor, as King Louis gave his jewels for the construction of the abbey church. When William was made Bishop of Chalons-sur-Marne in 1113, he was succeeded at Saint Victor's by another elected from their ranks, and so they had their own order that became a center of learning as well as of piety. The abbey was also blessed by the generosity of popes and nobility.</p><p>In the 16th century the 12th century buildings were demolished, and Francis I had a new church built. Everything was then destroyed during the French Revolution, when the Vicotine order was dissolved and the buildings leveled to make way for a metro station. At this time there are no known detailed plans or illustrations showing the church or other buildings that once stood there. It is remembered, however, that the church was once renowned for possessing one of the grandest collections of medieval stained glass windows in Paris.</p>"

Taking it into his hands, he shook the dust off it, and kneeling down venerated it with great devotion.</p><p>He had the picture renovated and placed it on the shelf in his cell, where he made it the object of his love and supplications in favor of those who came to him in their necessities and afflictions.</p><p>One night while he was praying fervently before the picture, he noticed that some dust had settled on it. Having nothing but his course woolen handkerchief he dusted it with that and apologized,</p><p>\"O pure and holiest Virgin, nothing in the whole world is worthy of touching your holy face, but since I have nothing but this coarse handkerchief, deign to accept my good will.\"</p><p>To his great surprise, the face of the Mother of God appeared to take on life, and smiling sweetly at him, she bowed her head, which thereafter remained inclined.</p><p>Fearing he was under an illusion, Dominic became troubled, but Mary assured him that his requests would be heard: he could ask of her with full confidence any favor he might desire. He fell upon his knees and offered himself entirely to the service of Jesus and Mary, and asked for the deliverance of one of is benefactor's souls in purgatory. Mary told him to offer several Masses and other good works; a short time after when he was again praying before the image, Mary appeared to him bearing the soul of his benefactor to Heaven. Dominic begged that all who venerated Mary in this image of Our Lady of Grace might obtain all they requested. In reply the Virgin gave him this assurance:</p><p>\"All those who devoutly venerate me in this picture and take refuge to me will have their request granted and I will obtain for them many graces; but especially will I hear their prayers for the relief and deliverance of the souls in purgatory.\"</p><p>Dominic soon after placed the image into the church of Maria Della Scala so that more devotees of Mary could venerate it. Many wonderful favors were obtained by those who honored and invoked Mary here. Reproductions were made of Our Lady of Grace and sent to different parts of the world. After the death of Dominic the original painting was lent to Prince Maximilian of Bavaria. He gave it to the discalced Carmelites in Munich in 1631; they gave it to Emperor Ferdinand II of Austria and his wife Eleanore. After Ferdinand's death, Eleanore entered the Carmelite convent in Vienna and took the picture with her. During the succeeding years the image was transferred to various places. Today it is in the monastery church of Vienna Doabling. September 27, 1931, it was solemnly crowned by Pope Pius XI  -  its 300th anniversary of arrival in Vienna.</p>"

In other times the inhabitants of Honfleur took delight in pointing out Our Lady of Grace, in reducing its steepness, in covering it with small, fine sand, so that a gracious princess, who had made herself beloved in these parts by her generous bounty, might be able to ascend it without fatigue, when she went to offer her prayers and vows to the Blessed Virgin.</p><p>The hurricane of revolutions has carried off the noble lady to a distance, as the wind bears away a rose leaf; but the remembrance of her beneficence still subsists.</p>"

Generations of these, however, have dwelt within the walls of the Old Monastery during two centuries and more, since the arrival of the statue in the last years of the 17th century.</p><p>In the annals of the Ursulines of the Sacred Heart at Perigueux, France, where the statue was solemnly crowned, we find the origin of the devotion. The devotion to Our Lady of Great Power began in the monastery of Issoudun. There a holy Ursuline nun, Mother Saint Peter, was inspired during her prayer to invoke Our Lady under this title. She spoke of her inspiration to her Sisters and her Superiors. The devotion was adopted with enthusiasm, and very soon it was decided that a statue be sculptured and a chapel built, dedicated to Our Lady of Great Power; she would henceforth be chosen as first and principal Superior of the Monastery.</p><p>The feast of the dedication took place February 25, 1673, and was celebrated with great pomp, as the chronicle testifies:</p><p>\"After High Mass two ecclesiastics carried the statue to the entry of the monastery where the nuns, in solemn procession, received it. It was placed on a richly decorated litter and, to the chanting of hymns, psalms and canticles, it was brought to the prepared chapel.\"</p><p>\"When the same statue was raised on its pedestal, the superior laid the keys of the monastery, the seals and constitutions at Our Lady's feet, begging her, in the name of the community, to accept the gift of all hearts, and of the entire monastery and to allow them to look on her as their Superior forever. Each rendered homage while hymns and canticles of thanksgiving were sung in Mary's honor.\"</p><p>Ever after, when a superior was elected, the ceremony was renewed and is still renewed in each Ursuline community every year on a principal feast of the Blessed Virgin; though homage is rendered only every three years, after the election or nomination of superiors.</p><p>The statue of Our Lady of Great Power was carried off and profaned during the dark days of the French Revolution. It was found and returned to the monastery at Perigueux; and the devotion continued fervently until 1892, when the bishop of Perigueux, in the name of the Soverign Pontiff, placed a richly jeweled crown on the head of the Mother and the Child, and ratified the numberless and signal favors obtained through Our Lady of Great Power.</p><p>Through the Ursulines in Quebec, the devotion soon spread through the New World. Before the altar in Quebec hangs the famous votive light promised to be kept burning as a token of thanks for favors granted to Mother Saint Agatha (Madeleine de Repentigny).

    "Our Lady of Guadalupe": {
        "eng": "<p>Mexico. The year of Our Lord 1531. Ten years and four months before, Hernan Cortes had accomplished the subjugation of the proud Aztec nation. And now, scarcely a decade later, a million and a half of the indigenous population had already embraced baptism and the Faith of Christ. On the ninth day of December in the year we speak of, one of these Indians, Juan Diego by name, left his humble dwelling in Cuautitlan. Juan was on his way to hear Mass at the Church of Santiago, in the barrio of Tlaltecloco. His way led past a hill called by the Indians Tepeyacac, and as dawn was breaking he arrived at the foot of the hill.</p><p>Suddenly there came to his ears the sound of sweet singing, like the voices of birds myriad and various, singing together with such ineffable harmony that the Indian was overcome with wonder and delight. Raising his eyes to the summit of Tepeyacac, Juan saw as it were a white and shining cloud, and within it a rainbow of color, with rays of dazzling light. The Indian stood spellbound, yet unafraid, filled with a sweet amazement, and asked himself whether it were all a dream.</p><p>\"What is this I hear and see? Where am I? By chance have I been transported to that Paradise of Delights where our race came into being? Or is it some heavenly country, hidden from the eyes of men?</p><p>The singing was stilled, but the Indian remained in a kind of enchantment, gazing at the shining cloud above him on the hill. And then he heard a voice, a woman's voice, soft and clear, calling to him from the midst of the cloud: \"Juan! Juan!\" Could he be hearing aright? Was the voice calling him? There it came again, this time more sweetly insistent: \"Juan! Come closer!\"</p><p>Gone was all hesitation. Almost in a bound Juan Diego reached the little eminence and stood just below the shining cloud. And then Juan saw her! Within the shining cloud there stood a beautiful Lady. The radiance of her garments transformed into the likeness of precious jewels the stones beneath her feet, and the leaves of the hawthorn and nopal appeared clusters of rare emeralds on surfaces polished and glowing. The very soil had become a carpet of jasper, tinted in many colors.</p><p>\"My son, Juan Diego, whom I love tenderly, like a small and delicate child! Where are you going?\" The Lady's words were spoken in Nahuatl, the language of Juan's people. Who can reproduce their delicacy of feeling in any other tongue?</p><p>\"O noble Mistress and my Lady,\" Juan answered, \"I am going to Mexico, to the barrio of Tlalteolco, to hear the Mass, which the ministers of God present for us in His place.\"</p><p>\"Know, my beloved son,\" replied the Lady, \"that I am the Ever-Virgin Mary, Mother of the true God, who is the Author of Life, the Creator of all things and the Lord of heaven and earth; who is everywhere. It is my wish that you build me a temple on this site. Here, as the loving Mother of you and of your fellow men, I will show forth my living kindness and compassion for your people and for those who love me and seek me, and call upon me in their labors and afflictions. Here I will hear their cries and their petitions, I will comfort and assuage. In order that my will may be accomplished, you must go to Mexico, to the palace of the Bishop who resides there. You are to tell him that I sent you, and that it is my pleasure that he build me a temple in this place. You will relate to him what you have seen and heard. And be certain of this: I will be grateful for what you do for me in this matter with which I charge you, and I will raise you up and make you renowned because of it. My son, you have heard my wish. Go in peace. And bear in mind that I will repay the labor and care that you employ; so in this matter exert all your strength.\"</p><p>On his knees and with head to the ground, Juan Diego answered: \"I go, most noble Lady and my Mistress, as your humble slave, to carry out your order.\"</p><p>And so the Indian took leave of the Lady.</p><p>He descended the western slope of the hill and took the road into the City of Mexico, a league distant. As he had promised the Lady, Juan went directly to the palace of the Bishop, Fray Juan de Zumarraga. He asked the servants to tell the Bishop he wanted to see him; but, because of the early hour, and because they saw only an Indian of the poorest class, the servants simply let him wait. Finally, however, struck by his patience, they let him in, to audience with the prelate. On his knees before the Bishop, Juan poured out his story. Bishop Zumarraga listened to the extraordinary tale and questioned Juan closely. In the end he sent the Indian away, telling him to return in some days.</p><p>Sorrowfully Juan left the palace. The Bishop, he felt, had not believed the story. What was more important to Juan Diego, he had failed to carry out the will of the Blessed Lady. With heavy heart he began the journey to his pueblo, Tolpetlac.</p><p>It was after sunset when he reached the summit of Tepeyacac. The Lady was waiting for him. As soon as Juan saw her, he prostrated himself in obeisance and began to speak. But what other tongue can adequately convey the beauty and gentleness, the courtesy, the delicate nuances, of Juan Diego's native Nahuatl? Listen: \"My well-beloved Daughter, my Queen and Lady most high! I did what you commanded me, although I did not talk to the Bishop until after a long wait. I gave him your message in the form you commanded me; he heard me calmly and with attention. But, from what I observed in his manner, and from the questions which he put to me, I gathered that he did not believe me; for he told me to come back at a later date, so that he might investigate the matter at length. He thinks that the temple you wish to be built for you is a tale of my own making, or my own fancy rather than your will. So I pray you, for this work send some noble and important personage, worthy of respect, whom he will believe. For as you see, my Mistress, I am only a poor rustic, a lowly man of the people, and unsuited for this business on which you send me. Pardon my boldness, my Queen, if I have failed in the reverence due to your high station. Let not your wrath fall upon me, nor may my answer displease you.\"</p><p>The Most Holy Mary listened to his tale with a benign countenance, and then answered:</p><p>\"Listen, my well-beloved son. Know you that I do not lack servants nor domestics under my command. For I have many whom I can send, if I wish, who will do what they are commanded. But it is fitting that you undertake this affair. It is through your intervention that my will and my desire must be done. So I ask you, my son, and I order you, to return tomorrow, to see and talk to the Bishop. Tell him to build me the temple that I ask, and tell him that she who sends you is the Virgin Mary, Mother of the true God.\"</p><p>\"Do not be displeased, O Queen and my Lady,\" Juan Diego replied, \"at what I have said. For I shall go willingly and with all my heart to obey your command and to carry your message. I was not making excuses, nor do I fear the journey nor the task. But perhaps I shall not be received nor listened to; or perhaps the Bishop, once he has heard me, will not believe.</p><p>Nevertheless, I shall do what yo command me. And I shall be waiting, Lady, tomorrow at sunset in this place, to give you the answer. And so remain in peace, and may God watch over you!\"</p><p>Even through the dim medium of a translation twice removed from the original tongue, the delicacy of expression of this humble, unlettered man comes to us clearly, to our wonder and delight. With reverence Juan Diego took his leave and continued on the way to his home in Tolpetlac. As far as we know, he said not a word to anyone about the matter. Perhaps, overcome by the events of the day and disturbed that the Bishop had not believed the events, he had decided to keep his own counsel for the time being.</p><p>The next day, December the tenth, was Sunday, and Juan went to the Church of Santiago in Tlaltelolco for Mass and the class in Christian doctrine which the Indian converts had to attend. Then he went again to the palace of the Bishop. Once more the servants made him wait a long time, but finally he was admitted.</p><p>Once more, prostrate and with tears and urgent words, Juan related to Bishop Zumarraga \"\u2026how for the second time he had seen the Mother of God in the same place that he had seen her the first time. That she was waiting for the reply to the message which she had given him earlier. That once again she had commanded him to go and tell the Bishop to build her a temple on the very site where he had seen and talked to her. That he should tell the Bishop that she who sent him was the Mother of Jesus Christ and the Ever-Virgin Mary.\"</p><p>The Bishop listened with greater attention this time, and began to think that there might be something to the tale. He questioned and re-questioned Juan Diego very closely, warning him to weigh his words carefully. He asked Juan to describe the appearance of the Virgin, and satisfied himself that it could be neither dream nor imagination. Yet, as Bishop, he could not appear to accept lightly such a tale from the lips of a simple Indian. So he replied:</p><p>\"What you have told me is not enough to make me undertake the task that you request. Therefore, tell the Lady who sent you to give you other signs, by which I may know that it is the Mother of God who sent you, and that it is he will that we build her a temple.\"</p><p>\"What sign would you like me to ask for?\" said Juan.</p><p>The calmness and confidence of Juan Diego strangely disturbed the Bishop. The Indian spoke as though the sign were as good as granted. And so the Bishop answered:</p><p>\"Let the Lady choose whatever sign seems good to her.\"</p><p>Then he summoned several of the most trusted servants in his household. Speaking to them in Spanish, which Juan did not understand, the Bishop told them to follow Juan without his knowledge, to report upon what he did and with whom he spoke. The servants followed Juan, easily keeping him in sight until he arrived at a little bridge crossing a stream, almost at the foot of Tepeyacac. Here the Indian disappeared from their sight, and although the servants looked everywhere, searching the hill on every side, Juan could not be found. They took him for either an impostor or a wizard, and returned to tell the Bishop what had occurred, asking him to punish the Indian if he should again come to the palace.</p><p>When Juan reached the summit of the hill, the Virgin was waiting for him. On his knees he told her what had happened: \"\u2026how,\" as the most ancient recital has it, \"carrying out her command, he had returned to the palace of the Bishop and had given him her message. And that, after questions and cross-questions, the Bishop had said that this simple tale was not sufficient to make him take action in so serious a matter.\"</p><p>Juan continued his relation:</p><p>\"I am to ask you, O Lady, for a particular sign, by which he may know that you sent me, and that it is your will that temple for you be built on this site.\"</p><p>With loving words Mary commended the care and diligence of Juan. She told him to return on the morrow, when she would give him a sign that the Bishop would believe. Juan promised to return, and took his leave of the Sovereign Lady.</p><p>But on the next day, Monday, December the eleventh, Juan was unable to keep his promise. Upon reaching his pueblo, he found that his uncle, Juan Bernardino, was seriously ill. The greater part of the day Juan spent in looking for a curandero (native medicine man) and when finally he found one, the latter's ministrations only made the sick man worse. Juan Bernardino requested his nephew to go early on Tuesday to the Convent of Santiago at Tlaltelolco, for a priest who would administer the last rites of the Church. Before daybreak on Tuesday, December the twelfth, therefore, Juan Diego set out for Tlaltelolco. But when he arrived at the foot of Tepeyacac, and was about to take the trail over the hill, he recalled his neglected promise to the Lady. Thinking that she would reproach him, he determined to avoid a meeting by skirting the hill. But as Juan approached the spot where today there is a spring of sparking water, Mary came forth to meet him.</p><p>Encompassed by a shining cloud, she came down the hill, directly across his path, and spoke: \"Where are you going, my son, and what road are you taking?\"</p><p>Struck with shame and fear, the Indian fell to the ground and answered:</p><p>\"My beloved Daughter and my Lady, may God watch over you! Do not be displeased at what I am going to tell you. Know, my Mistress, that one of your servants, my uncle, is gravely ill and about to die, and as he seems very weak I am going to the temple of Tlaltelolco for a priest to confess and anoint him. After having discharged this duty I will return here to obey your command. Forgive me, I pray you, my Lady, and bear with me a little. I am not asking to be excused from doing what you have commanded, nor is it a false excuse I give you. Tomorrow I will return without fail.\"</p><p>Mary heard the Indian's story with understanding in her face, and then spoke to him in this manner:</p><p>\"Listen, my son, to what I tell you now. Do not let anything worry or afflict you; do not fear illness nor any troublesome happening nor pain. Am I not here, I who am your Mother? Are you not under my shadow and protection? Am I not your life and health? Are you not in my embrace and in my prayers? What else do you need? Have no care nor worry about the illness of your uncle, for he will not die from it. Rest assured that he is already well.\"</p><p>Consoled by the words of Our Lady, Juan replied: \"Then send me, by Lady, to see the Bishop, and give me the sign of which you spoke so that he will believe me.\"</p><p>And Mary answered: \"My dearly beloved son, go up to the summit of the hill where you have seen me and talked with me, and cut the roses which you find there. Gather them into your cloak and bring them to me. I will tell you what you are to do and say.\" Without another word Juan obeyed, although he knew that the rocky summit had never produced flowers, nor vegetation of any kind. But, arriving at the top, he found a beautiful garden of Castilian roses, fresh and fragrant and covered with dew. Laying out his tilma (mantle), he gathered into it as many roses as it would hold, and carried them to Mary. And Mary gathered up the roses and rearranged them in the mantle of Juan Diego, saying: \"You see here the sign which you are to take to the Bishop. Tell him, by the sign of these roses, to do what I order him. And pay attention, my son, to what I am telling you, and know that I have confidence in you. Show no one on the way what you are carrying, nor open your cloak except in the presence of the Bishop, and tell him what I sent you for. This will convince him that he is to start work on my temple.\" <br/>And so saying, the Virgin sent him away.</p><p>At the Episcopal palace, Juan Diego asked to see Bishop Zumarraga; but as before, the retainers saw only a humble Indian, and paid him little attention. Finally someone became curious about what he was carrying so carefully in his tilma, but Juan refused to show them. With some force they pulled at the cloak, and obtained a glimpse of the roses. At this discovery the retainers informed the Bishop, and Juan was brought into his presence. The Indian gave him Our Lady's message, and added that he had brought from her the sign which the Bishop had demanded. When he let fall the ends of his mantle, a shower of roses covered the floor, and upon his garment was seen the image of Our Lady, just as Juan had seen her on the hill of Tepeyacac. The astonished Bishop venerated the miraculous image before his entire household and then bore it reverently to his private chapel.</p><p>Later, Juan was conducted, with signs of great respect, to the home of Juan Bernardino, by Spaniards who were commissioned to investigate the cure of the old man. Juan Bernardino related how the Most Holy Virgin had visited him at the very moment his nephew affirmed the cure had taken place, and had perfectly restored his health. The Virgin also told him \"...that it was her pleasure for a temple to be erected for him in the place where his nephew had seen her; and also that her sacred image was to be called Santa Maria de Guadalupe.\"</p><p>Such is the story as it happened, told without embellishment. Why Our Lady called her image Guadalupe she did not say, nor shall we know, until she herself reveals it to us. At any rate, the title is not to be confused with that of the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Extremadura, Spain, said to have been sculptured by Saint Luke, and representing the Divine Maternity of the Blessed Virgin. Juan Bernardino, speaking the Nahuatl language, most probably called the Virgin Xanta Malia Tecuauhtlanopeuh, which signifies, \"Saint Mary, she who appeared on the rocky summit.\"</p><p>What we do know is that the Virgin of guadalupe united the tribes and races of Mexico into a nation, for all recognize her as their Mother. Of the million and a half Indians baptized by 1531, almost all had been among the poor and the children. The noble Aztec families, mindful of their former glory, had nourished resentment of the Spanish conquerors and their religion. But with the miracle of Guadalupe, class distinctions were put aside, and noble and comoner, landholder and peasant, cacique and tribesman, embraced the Faith. Six years after Tepeyacac there were nine million converts among the Indiands, embracing he nucleus of all the nations among the tribes in the valley of Anahuac. Mexico thus became the first Christian nation of the American continent. The first little temple was finished, and the miraculous image placed therein on the twenty-sixth of December, 1531. This temporary structure was replaced by one of adobe, built at the expense of Bishop Zumarraga, and finished in 1533. The sacred image remained there until November, 1622, when Archbishop Juan de la Serna solemnly blessed a new collegiate church on the site. In 1895 the reconstruction of that edifice was completed for the Pontifical Coronation of the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In 1931 a further reconstruction was carried out, to commemorate the four-hundredth anniversary of the apparitions.</p><p>The beautiful image of the Blessed Virgin is obviously of miraculous origin, and science is at a loss to explain it. Those who honestly seek God will find proof of his existence here.</p><p>The fabric which the tilma was made of should have deteriorated after 20 years, yet it is hundreds of years old and in good condition. This is impossible for science to explain. An analysis of the image shows that there was no sketch made prior to the image being produced, and that it was made without brush strokes. Modern science is unfamiliar with the substance used to produce the image. Even though the fabric is course, the images of several people can be seen reflected in the eyes of the Virgin, just as they would be in a living person's eyes. The placement of those images, and the distortion that is the effect of the curve of a normal eye, is impossible to reproduce on a flat surface. The stars about Our Lady on the mantle coincide with the constellations that were in the sky on December 12, 1531.</p><p>In 1921 a bomb was placed before the image by those who hate God and His Holy Catholic Church. It exploded with such force that a heavy cast iron crucifix was bent backwards, a marble communion rail destroyed, and yet the tilma remained completely undamaged!</p><p>The result of this act of hatred and violence against the Church and Our Lady obviously did not have the effect that the perpetrators intended, for their act further confirms that the miraculous preservation of the image is supernatural in origin and enjoys the protection of Christ and his holy Mother!</p>"

    "Our Lady of Guam": {
        "eng": "<p>Our Lady of Guam, the miraculous statue to which the natives have such deep devotion, is three feet high, all ivory from the delicate classical face of Our Lady to the hem of her exquisite gown. She has a head of brown hair, adorned with a beautiful crown, and golden rings hang from her tiny ears. According to the Jesuit history of the island, Our Lady's coming was miraculous.</p><p>A Spanish soldier, in the year 1825, was fishing a distance from the shore between the village of Mirizo and Umatac when he saw a strange object floating upon the waves. He moved closer and saw that it was a statue, supported by giant golden crabs, holding lighted candles in their claws. The soldiers claiming the statue as their own, installed it as Patroness in their barracks. They made a shrine for her, a wall recess with doors like a cupboard or camarino, from which Our Lady of the Cupboard takes her name. She is called Santa Maria de Camarino.</p><p>She made her home many years in the barracks, but the atmosphere did not always please her. She would be found missing, only to return with the edge of her mantle full of burs. When the soldiers were drunk with coconut brew, she would slam the doors of her cupboard shut against them.</p><p>No one remembers how she came to leave the barracks for the cathedral of Agana, but on the fourteenth of April a great earthquake occurred, terrorizing the natives and destroying their homes. It is believed that on that day she deserted the uncouth soldiers and showed herself to be the Patroness of the people and of Guam in particular. Many miracles of protection are attributed to Our Lady of Guam on this day.</p><p>On the eve of this day the people place a lighted candle outside their tight-closed shutters; they do this in memory of their Fathers who made the promise to Santa Maria de Camarino. In 1825 and again in 1834, they vowed to celebrate yearly a special feast for her protection from Linao, the earthquake, and Pagyo, the typhoon. On its part the miraculous statue has seen to it that no devout life has since that time been lost. Earthquakes and typhoons have come and left destruction, yet they have never taken one life or harmed the children of Santa Maria de Camarino, Our Lady of Guam.</p><p>Such is the story of Our Lady of the Cupboard, the miraculous virgin of Guam; to the eyes of fact simply a beautiful statue, some three feet height, executed with all the refinement of eighteenth century art, yet to the eye of faith, she is power incarnate. She is all ivory, but where that ivory came from, or what artist fashioned those exquisite hands, she alone can tell, just as she is the only one who knows the truth of her coming to Guam.</p><p>Flags of various nations have flown over the royal coconut trees of Agana: admirals and governors have come and gone, and each in his proper time has departed. Spanish architecture has had its day, and the Seabee buildings mushroomed all over the island. Yet, Santa Maria de Camarino abides through all changes to cherish her strangely chosen people. She reigns affectionately in the hearts of the people, the natives, as their Queen and Patroness.</p><p>When American Marines and Soldiers during the latter part of July, 1944, captured the island of Guam, the native population was for the most part Catholic. The Faith was brought there, no doubt, by Spanish priests who accompanied Magellan when he sailed around the world. The natives are called Charmorros, offspring of Spanish and Micronesian ancestors, religions, most progressive, most cultured of the people of the Mariana Islands. The greatest majority of them are brown-skinned, pleasantly featured, shy, well mannered, scrupulously clean. They know the American way of life, since they have lived for more than fifty years under the benevolent guidance of the Stars and Stripes. And Mary, Our Lady of Guam, Our Lady of the Cupboard, loves them and protects them.</p>"

    "Our Lady of Guard": {
        "eng": "<p>Late one afternoon during the thirteenth century, a solitary French fisherman was fishing off the harbor of Marseille. Before he became aware of it, a terrific storm burst upon him. His boat tossed around like a shell, and filled with water faster than he could bail it out. His rudder was lost; his mast snapped. Cutting himself free from the rigging with a knife, he had saved himself temporarily from certain drowning. Still, everything looked hopeless, and he felt he could never get back to the harbor. The fisherman thought of the family he would never see again and cast a despairing look at the city, the huge rock standing like a sentinel or guard on the mountain which overtopped the city and harbor.</p><p>Dimly through the gloom he suddenly saw a solitary figure of a lady, dressed in white, standing firmly on the very top of the rock. She seemed to be extending her hand as if she would help him to the shelter and safety of the harbor. At once it came to him that the Lady so calmly defying the wind and rain could only be the Blessed Mother, so he prayed to her to help him.</p><p>Almost immediately his boat ceased its wild tossing, righted itself and pushed by a friendly gust of wind, raced into the calm water of the harbor until it drove onto the shore at the very foot of the mountain. Stepping onto the shore, the fisherman fell to his knees and poured out his thanks to the Blessed Virgin, and then hurried home to his worried family.</p><p>The story of his rescue through the assistance of Our Lady quickly spread throughout the port. It was remembered that other sailors, on numerous occasions during severe storms, had also seen the figure of the Lady on top of the rock. Always when she had appeared, the angry seas had calmed and their crafts had ridden safely into the shelter.</p><p>Soon everyone came to believe that the rock was the spot on which the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Guard, would appear whenever her help was desperately required. In thanksgiving to her the sailors of Marseille, in 1213-1218, erected a chapel on top of the rock. In it they enshrined a lovely statue of Our Lady.</p><p>Around 1544, the chapel was replaced by a large church and the statue transferred to it. Sometime during the French Revolution the statue of Our Lady of Guard was destroyed, but during the 1830's a new statue was dedicated. That Mary did confine her help only to sailors was proved in the year 1832 when a severe epidemic of cholera struck Marsilles; the people decided to appeal to Mary. Forming a procession, they climbed the mountain, removed the statue from the chapel, brought it down, and solemnly carried it through the streets of the city. Almost immediately the epidemic waned, and in a few days vanished. So they called Mary, Our Lady of Help  -  the sailors called her Our Lady of Mariners.</p><p>Some years later, as the fame of the shrine on top of the mountain spread, with more and more people coming up to pay their respects. The shrine acquired still another name, a name more reflective of who Our Lady truly is for all who call upon her  -  Notre Dame de la Guarde  -  Our Lady of Guard, or Guardian.</p><p>In Marseilles today, the hill of Notre Dame de la Garde is topped by a beautiful basilica, at an altitude of 550 feet, which was built in 1864. This commanding site, however, has been occupied by a chapel since the year 1214. The interior has a multitude of sailors' votive offerings, and model ships are hung in all parts of it in sign of thanksgiving for all the mariners who have been assisted by their heavenly mother. A golden statue of the Virgin and Child suitably dominates the city from its place on top of the western tower.</p>"

They were honoring an image of the Mother of God, a statue on a rough pedestal. The natives told the Spanish that the statue had the power to make their petitions come true, and indeed, miracles were performed.</p><p>Since nothing of the origin could be learned, the sailors determined to name the statue by some \"Lady Title\"; the lot fell upon \"Our Lady of Guidance\"; everyone agreed she had guided them on their dangerous journey.</p><p>When the cathedral at Manila was built the statue was enshrined there. A hundred years later, this cathedral having been destroyed, a new church was built, and it is visible from the sea. In its high tower a light was set as a beacon to incoming ships, a fit place for Our Lady of Guides. Later the statue was placed within the walls of the restored cathedral.</p><p>As to the mysterious nature of the statue's unknown origin, some think the statue floated in from a wrecked ship, and was so seized by the natives.</p><p>The statue of Our Lady of Guidance was canonically crowned in the year 1955 by the Papal Nuncio to the Philippine Islands. The shrine is visited by laborers seeking employment in many countries, and when they return they leave gifts of thanks for the Queen of Heaven before her statue.</p><p>Today the devotion to Our Lady of Guides still flourishes.

    "Our Lady of Happy Assembly": {
        "eng": "<p>Le Laus (pronounced Lows) is a little village in southeastern France, 60 miles to the southeast of Grenoble. The story of Mary's shrine there centers around a young woman named Benoite Rencurel, who was born on September 29, 1647 of humble parents in the little village of Saint Etienne, not far from Le Laus. Her father died when she was seven and after his death her mother found life rather difficult. So, when Benoite was 12, she went to work on a neighboring farm, tending the farmer's sheep. Each day while the flock grazed she spent a few minutes praying to the Blessed Virgin at a little wayside chapel.</p><p>One day, in 1664, Benoite led her little flock into a small valley near Saint Etienne and there toward the end of the afternoon, a Lady and Child appeared to her, standing on top of a rock, a large rock, known locally as Les Flours. The Lady did not speak to Benoite, but smiled in a very friendly way and after a few minutes Lady and Child vanished. However, similar apparitions continued almost daily for two months. Of course, rumors of what was occurring gradually spread around the neighboring countryside.</p><p>Finally, M. Grimaud, a district magistrate, questioned Benoite at length and suggested that if the lady appeared again, Benoite should ask her who she was. The girl agreed; on the very next day the Lady appeared, she asked her to please say who she was  -  was she the Mother of God? The Lady answered:</p><p>\"Yes, I am Mary, the Mother of Jesus. My Son wishes to be especially honored in this valley, but not on this spot.\"</p><p>With these words she vanished. Benoite did not see her again for a few days. On September 29, while tending her flock at another pasture, Pindreau, a very brilliant light suddenly appeared on top of some rocks. In the center of the light stood the Blessed Virgin. She told Benoite to go to Le Laus, where she would find a little chapel, filled with a delicious perfume, and there she would also see her. Benoite soon found herself at the little chapel of Our Lady of Good Meeting or Happy Assembly (Notre-Dame de Bon Recontre) and going in, she saw the Blessed Virgin over the high altar, on which stood her image. And the Virgin said to Benoite,</p><p>\"On this spot I wish a church built  -  a privileged sanctuary, wherein many sinners will repent. Means will not be wanting, despite the poverty of the country people around.\"</p><p>The news of this event soon spread; crowds came to the little chapel, which was too small to contain them. So, in 1665, Msgr. Lambert, Vicar General of the Archdiocese, gave permission for a church to be built over the little chapel.</p><p>Since there was very little money available with which to hire workmen, the villagers and peasants for miles around carried the stones and built the walls for Our Lady of Happy Assembly  -  aided by the many pilgrims who came to worship and remained a while to help in the building of the church.</p><p>In 1692, during an invasion by the Duke of Savoy the church was partly destroyed, but the statue of Our Lady of Happy Assembly was not damaged. The church was soon repaired and restored. In 1716 a new statue of the Virgin was carved and enshrined behind the main altar of the church. It is said that Benoite wished the new statue to be named Our Lady of Happy Assembly of Laus. The original statue was transferred to a chapel behind the main altar. In 1885 Pope Pius IX gave official recognition to the title of Our Lady of Laus of Happy Assembly, when he ordered the new statue to be solemnly crowned. Benoite Rencurel died on December 28, 1718, and was buried in a vault in front of the altar in the church at Le Laus.</p>"

His great desire was to restore the lost western half of the ancient Roman Empire to his control to reunite it with the Byzantine Empire in the east. He was largely successful. Justinian never fought personally in any of his campaigns, for he had a talented and capable general named Belisarius to lead his armies.</p><p>The Byzantine Emperor began his conquests by attacking the Vandal kingdom in North Africa. In the year 530 AD, King Hilderic of the Vandals had been overthrown and imprisoned by Gelimer, who was his cousin. As Hilderic had been on friendly terms with Justinian, and had maintained good relations with the local Catholic clergy, Justinian decided to answer his appeal for assistance as an excuse to sail to the Vandal kingdom and conquer it.</p><p>In the year 533, General Belisarius set sail with a Byzantine fleet that included 92 Dromons, which were a type of ancient galley, and an additional 500 transports. They landed with an army of about 15,000 soldiers, reinforced with an unknown number of barbarian troops. They met the Vandals, who had an army of approximately 11,000 men, at the Battle of Ad Decimum, on 14 September 533.</p><p>At one point during the battle, Belisarius' main army had suffered serious casualties and was beginning to collapse, while his cavalry had already been routed. It seemed he was about to be beaten by the Vandals if they but made but one more assault, yet they inexplicably failed to do so.</p><p>It seems the Vandal usurper had come upon the body of his brother, who had been killed earlier in the battle, and then was so overcome with sorrow that he ordered that his brother's body should be buried immediately. In essence, then, the Vandals had no leader while all of this was occurring.</p><p>Belisarius took the opportunity to gather his own forces and regroup, returning to attack the Vandals as they hesitated and eventually drove them from the field of battle.</p><p>Belisarius then went on to take Carthage, and afterward, at the Battle of Tricamarum on 15 December 533, the last Vandal army was defeated and the conquest of North Africa completed.</p><p>Emperor Justinian was known as a great builder of monuments and churches, and Our Lady of Justinienne was built in honor of the Blessed Virgin in Carthage.</p><p>Justinian's reign was a long one, and by the time of his death he had constructed many splendid edifices to the glory of God.

        "eng": "<p>Kieff on the banks of the Dneiper River was the first resting place of this famous image of Mary. Here, according to legend, the Apostle Saint Andrew had once stopped on his way from Constantinople to Rome. Waking in the morning to the sights of the heights of Kieff, he was moved to prophecy:</p><p>\"See those hills? On those hills shall shine hereafter the grace of God.\"</p><p>However, it was nearly 1,000 years, 1010, to be exact, before the Russian Prince Vladimir was baptized at Kieff with all his people, and the teachings of the Gospel began to go out from the heights that had so impressed the Apostle.</p><p>The prince sent to Kherson for a picture of Our Lady which was, according to legend, painted by Constantine, and according to another, commissioned by him, which seems more likely. The Prince endowed the monastery in Petchersk to house the famous picture and here it remained until the fifteenth century.</p><p>In 1467 Ivan III, Grand Duke of Moscow, built the Church of the Assumption in the Kremlin as a memorial of his marriage. As a crowning jewel of his new church, he asked for the famous picture of Kieff. This aged city was both grieved and frightened at the demand. The people rose in protest; they did not want to lose their dearest treasure. Then the Blessed Virgin appeared in sleep to the prince and told him to give up the picture, because she would personally see that it was replaced. He gave it to the agents of the Duke of Moscow on the following morning and returned to his church to find that another picture exactly like it had mysteriously appeared in the place of the one he had returned.</p><p>Kieff and Moscow were still disputing vigorously up to fifty years ago, the 400-year old customary disagreement over which city had the original picture of Our Lady of Kieff, and which had the one placed there by the Blessed Mother. There are thousands of copies now spread all over the world.</p>"

        "eng": "<p>Around 862, a band of Norsemen settled in Novgorod and organized the Slavs of that region into an independent state  -  the nucleus of the future Russia. Kiev, about 20 years later became the capital. By the end of the ninth century, missionaries from Constantinople had converted many of the inhabitants to Christianity.</p><p>During the three succeeding centuries, Kiev become the intellectual and religious center of the country, and numerous convents and monasteries arose in Kiev and the surrounding territory. One of these was staffed by the Dominicans. To it there came in the early years of the thirteenth century a Dominican Father by the name of Hyacinth  -  Saint Hyacinth, the Apostle of the North; also Apostle of Poland and Russia. Hyacinth had a burning ambition to convert the pagans and infidels of China, Mongolia and outer Russia (the Tartans), to the Christian faith. In this dedicated task he made numerous journeys, mostly be foot, into the far countries lying beyond Kiev. Between these travels he rested and recuperated at the Dominican House at Kiev.</p><p>During one of these rest periods (1240) word came to the monastery that the Mongols had invaded the country. They had marched across the Caucasus, swept over central and southern Russia and now Kiev itself was in imminent danger of attack by the pagan hordes. Hyacinth, on hearing the tragic news, rushed to the nearby church to save the Blessed Sacrament from capture and desecration. He had removed the Sacred Host from the Tabernacle and was hurrying down the aisle when he heard a voice call out, \"Hyacinth, are you going to leave me here at the mercy of the Tartans?\" The voice seemed to be coming from the statue of the Blessed Virgin on one of the side altars. Hyacinth stopped and turned his gaze toward the statue which was of alabaster, fairly large in size, and obviously much too weighty for one man to carry. What should he do? Then the voice spoke again: \"Take me with you, Hyacinth, I will make the burden light.\" So, holding the Blessed Sacrament in one hand, he picked up the statue with the other, and, to his surprise, found he could easily carry it. Leaving the church, he fled from the city, and saved the Blessed Sacrament and the statue of Our Lady from harm.</p><p>Eighty years later after the Mongols had been driven away, the statue was returned to Kiev. That city became the center of great devotion to the Blessed Virgin, and it was natural that people soon gave the statue the name of Our Lady of Kiev.</p><p>The statue was later taken to a Dominican convent in Lwow in Poland. What has happened to it since the Communists took over Poland is unknown. But surely, Our Lady still pleads to each of us, \"Take me with you; I will make the burden light.\" She will always make all our burdens light and bearable, as long as we keep her with us always and everywhere. </p>"

On her right was Saint Joseph, his head inclined toward her and on her left Saint John the Evangelist. To the left of Saint John was an altar on which stood a cross and a lamb.\" Standing only a few feet off the ground, the Blessed Virgin wore a white cloak and was described by witnesses as being incredibly beautiful. She wore a bright golden crown, and appeared to be praying with her eyes looking toward heaven with her arms bend in front of her with her palms facing inward.</p><p>Fifteen parishioners stood to witness the apparition for two hours as they recited the rosary. Although it was daylight when the apparition began, the weather turned for the worse and it began to rain heavily. The area around the apparition appeared unaffected, however, as the ground remained dry as long as the vision lasted. She did not speak, but the gable of the church where the manifestation was made was covered with a cloud of light.</p><p>Saint Joseph, the foster-father of Jesus, also wore white robes and stood on the Virgin's right. He inclined his head respectfully toward the Blessed Virgin. Saint John the Evangelist wore a mitre, and appeared to be preaching as he held a book in his left hand.</p><p>Since then thousands of people have gone to Knock to pray to Our Lady. Their prayerful, penitential and reverential spirit has been commended again and again by visitors from other lands. No sign of commercialism detracts from the purely religious atmosphere of that hallowed spot. People from all walks of life kneel in humble supplication before the shrine of Our Lady, fully confident that she has sanctified that spot by her apparition.</p><p>Organized pilgrimages from various dioceses are conducted frequently to the shrine of Our Lady of Knock. The rosary comprises the main portion of the devotion; the shrine is therefore appropriately called the Rosary Shrine. The \"Knock Shrine Annual\" relates many interesting stories of cures and conversions effected at the shrine.</p>"

In the year 1828 a surveyor, Joseph Bouchette, ventured into the region for the purpose of collecting data for topographical maps. It was during this expedition that he found a suitable site for a future village, which Pascal Dumais and his family later settled. This marked the founding of the village of Lac-Bouchette, with more and more people coming to settle in the area until the village had 300 inhabitants in about the year 1888.</p><p>Our story actually begins with a man named Charles Napoleon Robitaille, a salesman who traveled the roads in and around Quebec. During the winters he would have to cross frozen rivers, and it was in the winter of 1878 while trying to cross the Saguenay River that the ice broke under the weight of his horse and sleigh. Pulled beneath the surface of the icy waters, Charles was alone and completely helpless. Knowing he was dying, he implored the Blessed Virgin Mary to save him.</p><p>Charles miraculously survived, and managed to escape from the river with his life. He knew the Virgin had assisted him, and so to honor Mary and her recent apparition at Lourdes, he asked Louis Jobin to create a huge statue of the Blessed Virgin sculpted in the image of Our Lady of Lourdes. He envisioned the statue in the heights overlooking the mouth of the river. The statue Jobin sculpted became known as Notre-Dame du Saguenay.</p><p>The finished statue is an impressive 35 feet high, and weighs 3 tons. Sculpted of solid white pine, it was then sheathed in lead to protect the statue from the harsh weather. Hauling such a huge statue into place was a difficult task in the late nineteenth century. After being constructed, it was broken down into 14 separate pieces and then hoisted into place to be put together again. On the right side of the base of the statue, the sculptor affixed a lead plate on which is written: \"Louis Jobin, Quebec.\" The statue made him the most famous sculptor of the time, and the statue has become a regional landmark, with visitors from the world over assembling at her feet to sing the Ave Maria.</p><p>In 1889 the mission church of Saint Thomas Aquinas was built, and the next year Father Joseph Ironwood became the first pastor. A second church was soon built, in 1898, as the population increased dramatically. Now, on the north shore of Lake Bouchet, in the province of Quebec, there stand the buildings of a friary and the sanctuary of Our Lady of the Sagueney.</p><p>In 1920, Father Elzear Delamarre built a house and a private chapel dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua on the site, which later became known as the hermitage of Saint Anthony and is one of the national shrines in Quebec.

The storm and rain stopped suddenly with the arrival into the city of a procession carrying the miraculous icon. Since that time these processions have been repeated annually. There is even an incredible arched walkway that is only a little short of four kilometers on length that is meant to protect the icon from the elements, as well as those on procession.</p><p>The icon shows the Blessed Virgin Mary holding the Infant Jesus in blessing.

Their attention was drawn to a globe of light a short distance away. While they gazed, the globe opened and they saw a woman seated on some stones which surrounded the bed of a dried stream. Her elbows rested on her knees, her face was buried in her hands, and she wept.</p><p>The children were frightened and did not know what to do, when the Lady arose and in the sweetest of tones, said:</p><p>\"Come near, my children; do not be afraid. I am here to tell you great news.\"</p><p>The children obeyed and when they were close, they saw that the woman's countenance was of rare beauty, though her eyes were filled with tears. They saw that her shoes were sparkling white, the buckles on them were square and golden. Encircling the soles were tiny roses which did not crush as she stood on the tips of the blades of grass. Her apron was golden and it reached to the bottom of her full white dress. Her arms folded before her were concealed within broad straight sleeves which reached beyond her fingertips. Along the border of her plain white kerchief crossed on her breast, ran many-colored roses both large and small, and besides these was a flat, thin gold chain about an inch in breadth.</p><p>The face of Our Lady of La Salette was so resplendent with light that the noon-day sun lost its brightness for the children; her complexion was a pale white such as those who have been bowed down with suffering. Her beauty was radiant, so dazzling, so scintillating, that Melanie was frequently rubbing her eyes, thinking that by so doing she might see the better, while Maximin could see her face but vaguely. Her headdress was white and above it, a royal diadem wreathed with roses of many hues glittered, while on her bosom rested a golden crucifix, with the pincers and hammer of the Passion. Her majestic beauty was ravishing; her face exceedingly beautiful  -  yet profoundly sad. It was not earthly.</p><p>Mary, Our Lady of La Salette, stood with her head bent toward the children. Her mien and her manner were reassuring and kind, but also sorrowful. They listened to her voice; a voice far sweeter than the sweetest melody:</p><p>\"If my people do not submit, I shall be forced to let go the hand of my Son. It is so strong, so heavy, that I can no longer withhold it. How long a time do I suffer for you! If I would not have my Son abandon you, I am compelled to pray to Him without ceasing. And as to you, you take no heed of it. However much you pray, however much you do, you shall never recompense the pains I have taken for you.\"</p><p>Then Our Lady of La Salette told them that the two things which at that time pained her Son most were the neglect of Sunday observance and blasphemous language. She foretold a great famine, and asked the children to make known her message. She walked off a bit, lifted her gaze toward heaven and vanished.

    "Our Lady of Las Lajas": {
        "eng": "<p>There are many amazing incidents involving apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary related throughout history, and nearly countless times where she has come to give her special assistance to men. One of the most astonishing events involves a little known apparition, Our Lady of Las Lajas, and a miracle that can still be witnessed today on a cliff face of Guaitara Canyon in Colombia, South America.</p><p>It was in the year 1754 when a woman named Maria Mueses de Quinones was traveling from her home in the village of Potosi to the neighboring village of Ipiales, which was about 6 miles away. The trail had turned down into the gorge formed by the Guaitara River when Maria was caught in a sudden squall. She did not like this shadowy and overgrown place, for she, like all the natives, believed the grotto known as Las Lajas (The Rocks) was inhabited by the devil. Despite her fears, Maria was soon forced by the violence of the storm to take refuge there anyway.</p><p>Making the Sign of the Cross and invoking the aid of the Blessed Virgin, Maria peered fearfully into the darkness as she took her first few halting steps into the cave. Surrounded by the awful darkness she was just beginning to look about when she felt someone, or something, moving directly behind her. Afraid to turn around, she ignored the feeling until she felt a finger begin tapping her insistently on the shoulder. Certain it was the devil himself, Maria fled out into the raging storm.</p><p>Maria had a young daughter named Rosa, a child who had been a deaf-mute since birth. Sometime later, returning home from Ipiales, Maria was carrying Rosa on her back on the way to their village when she suddenly was suddenly overcome by exhaustion. Unable to go any further, she sat down and rested on a large stone near the dreadful grotto.</p><p>\"Mommy, look at the mestiza who has detached herself from the rock with a little boy in her arms and two little mestizos at her side!\"With a stifled cry Maria sprang to her feet, for it was her little Rosa who had spoken. Now the child was beginning to crawl happily up the tumbled stones toward the entrance to the grotto. Maria caught up her daughters' hand and lifted the child from the rubble before turning to flee without once looking back.</p><p>Maria's friends, and all the other inhabitants of her village, knew that Rosa had been mute since birth, though now she was merrily chattering along like any other child her age. There were many questions, none of which Maria was able to answer, for she did not understand what had happened herself.</p><p>Even though Maria was still suspicious of the grotto, she would bring her daughter Rosa back from time to time to leave flowers or candles in thanksgiving.</p><p>One day, after life had seemingly returned to normal, it was noticed that Rosa had disappeared. Maria searched for her daughter everywhere, but could not find the little girl. Then it occurred to her how excited Rosa would become when visiting the grotto, and having failed to find her anywhere else, she hurried there at once.</p><p>Maria was not wrong. What she saw at the grotto caused her to fall to her knees upon her arrival, for she beheld her own daughter Rosa playing with an extraordinarily handsome boy of her own age, and watching over them both was a magnificent queen. Maria knew at once it was the Christ child and Mary, His purest Mother.</p><p>Perhaps Maria felt unworthy of what she had seen, or was unwilling to answer the many questions that would surely be asked, for she did not speak what she had seen to anyone. Her joy over what she had seen was short lived, however, as little Rosa soon became sick, and in a short while died of her sudden malady.</p><p>Overwhelmed with grief, Maria returned to the grotto carrying in her arms the lifeless body of her little Rosa. It was there that her child had once received her voice and her hearing. Perhaps there would be another miracle, and she would regain her life. Maria prayed with confidence for her daughter's life, reminding the Blessed Virgin of how devoted Rosa was to her, bringing flowers and candles to the grotto in her honor since she had been cured. It was not long before Maria received that for which she begged, as Rosa drew breath and opened her eyes to look up at her mother. It was as if she had only been asleep.</p><p>Word of this new miracle spread quickly, and many of the local people joined the next day in a procession with their priests in order to give thanks at the site of the apparition. When they arrived at the grotto they were all stunned to witness a brilliant portrait none had ever seen or heard of before.</p><p>Imprinted on the face of the cliff was an image of the Blessed Virgin holding her infant Son in her arms. Both are smiling sweetly. The Virgin's hair is long and dark brown, extending to about the elbow. Her eyes are large and innocent, and her garments beautiful to behold. On one side of them is an image of Saint Dominic and on the other is Saint Francis of Assisi. Mary is extending her hand toward Saint Dominic, holding a Rosary. The Holy Infant holds a Franciscan cord which he appears to be giving to Saint Francis. The spiritual sons of these two holy saints were responsible for the conversion of the people of Central and South America.</p><p>There was a priest, Father John de Santa Gertrudis, who desired to build a church to honor the Blessed Virgin at the site of the miraculous image. The fact that he lost the use of his sight did not deter him from the task, as he walked back and forth the length and breadth of the region begging for the money he would need to build the chapel. It was not until 1764 when he had collected the money he needed, and construction began. On the glorious day when the church was completed, the Blessed Virgin showed her appreciation to her faithful son. As the priest knelt before her image that he so loved in thanksgiving, it suddenly became visible to him, and Father John de Santa Gertrudis realized that his sight had been restored.</p><p>The image of Our Lady of Las Lajas, is clearly of miraculous origin. The colors have not lost any of their brilliance over the centuries, and they are not a paint or coloring that has been applied to the surface of the stone. Geological samples collected have proven that the color actually permeates the rock, for, as impossible as it may sound, the colors of the image are perfectly evenly distributed and reach several feet into the face of the cliff. Scientists cannot explain it, while those who hate God deny the obvious and attempt to distort the truth of its miraculous origin.</p><p>A Gothic style church has since been built to house the wondrous image, and in 1952 Pope Pius XII granted a canonical crowning of Our Lady of Las Lajas and her Divine Son.</p>"

How could Mary abandon at this supreme moment anyone who has faithfully called upon her during life?</p><p>Because Mary has merited by her own death the power of succoring her faithful servants at the moment of the great passage from life to eternity; having assister her Divine Son during His agony and death on the Cross, she received from Him the mission of assisting us equally during our agony and at the hour of our death.</p><p>It is through Mary that Jesus was given to us, when He came a tiny Babe in the infirmity of human flesh, wrapped up in swaddling clothes, in order to save us; it is equally through Mary that on the last day we hope to see face to face this same Jesus surrounded by the glory of the Father  -  the source of eternal happiness for us: \"And after this our exile, show unto us the Blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\"</p><p>A true servant of Mary cannot perish, because devotion to this divine Mother, in keeping us virtuous, gives us a certain pledge that Heaven will be ours. Death is the crown of life: a good life cannot end in eternal loss. If we prove ourselves worthy of Mary's assistance, as Our Lady of Last Agony, she is bound to procure for us the special grace of a holy death.</p>"

She has always been faithful to her children by grace.</p><p>It was as a result of one period of persecution that a number of Vietnamese Catholics found refuge about 1785 in a jungle that hardy foresters would hesitate to penetrate. Here they stayed hidden, suffering privations, dangers and illnesses, in order to practice their religion. One of the few comforts they had was reciting the rosary every day at dusk.</p><p>On one such evening, they were first frightened and then enchanted to behold a Woman and Child standing nearby in a mysterious glow of light. Simple as these people were, some among them recognized the Virgin Mother and Her Child. All listened entranced while Mary told them softly that she was fully aware of their hardships and of their chronic sickness due to contaminated water. She told them to gather certain leaves that grew near and make a strong tea of them; this would keep them healthy. Solemnly she added, \"From this day on, prayers said on this spot will be heard  -  and answered.\" The year was 1798.</p><p>Not long after the Virgin's visit, the people heard that the persecution they escaped had ended. Most went back to their original homes; they could talk about little but the apparition they had seen, and word of this miracle spread.</p><p>By 1820 even the Buddhists believed in Our Lady's promise and built the first little shrine, a pagoda, on the spot where Mary had been seen. Within a short time these Buddhists become Christians; and their small shrine became the first Church of Our Lady of Lavang. The faithful found solace and courage in this devotion in times of oppression and general misery that have come again and again to the Vietnamese.</p><p>In 1885 during a period of rabid anti-Christianity, the Lavang chapel was burned; a priest, Father Philip Minh, now Blessed Philip, was beheaded. There was another lull between attacks and work was begun on a building to replace the burnt chapel.</p><p>There were great difficulties in transporting supplies plus lack of adequate funds, but the great church of Our Lady of Lavang somehow evolved and was dedicated in 1901 in the name of the Protecting Mother of the faithful. A congress of all dioceses of Viet Nam was called and Lavang became a place of pilgrimage for countless devout people of Southeast Asia.</p><p>During the Marian Congress of 1961 a new basilica of Our Lady of Lavang was dedicated by Archbishop Peter Ngo-Dinh Thue of Hue. At that time he told Catholics of South Viet Nam that he received messages still from Catholics in North Communist Viet Nam who say they never fail to believe that the Holy Virgin of Lavang will one day deliver their country from Communist oppressors.</p><p>Viet Nam is a land of many martyrs. Across the centuries, devoted religious, scholars, leaders and the poor have paid homage to Mary.</p>"

        "eng": "<p>The pilgrimage to Our Lady of Liesse, in Picardy, not so old as those of the south of France, as it does not go farther back than the twelfth century, surpasses them in celebrity. The origin of the statue of the Blessed Virgin, which adorns this holy place, is very marvelous; the tradition has been preserved, not only in the province of France where it is found, but also in the Holy Land. We are even assured that it exists in the archives of the Knights of Malta. Here is the tradition, which bears a very decided oriental stamp.</p><p>Foulques of Anjou, King of Jerusalem, having rebuilt the fortress of Bersabee, four leagues from Ascalon, to protect the frontier of his kingdom against the incursions of the Saracens, confided the care of it to the brave and pious knights of Saint John of Jerusalem. This valiant garrison was often engaged against the infidels who held the ancient country of the Philistines for the Sultan of Egypt.</p><p>One day the knights of Saint John, among whom were three brothers of the ancient and opulent house of Eppes, in Picardy, fell into an ambush, and in spite of prodigies of valor, were taken and laden with chains by the Muslims, who sent them into Egypt. The gentlemen of Eppes had the lofty mien, the tall stature, and the heroic bearing of the ancient nobles of the north of France.The sultan at once singled them out, and, desirous of gaining them over to his false prophet, began by throwing them into a dungeon to weaken their courage. He held before their eyes afterwards the most enticing prospects, in order to draw them into apostasy.</p><p>The three warriors, who had been inaccessible to fear, were deaf to the noise of gold and the voice of ambition. The sultan, deceived in his expectations, sent to them the most celebrated imams, to argue with them upon faith. The good knights, through disgust of Islam, became all at once subtle theologians, and defended Christianity as well in dispute as they had often done with the shield on their arm and the lance in their grasp.</p><p>The sultan considered himself bound in honor to vanquish the captives, and his opposition increased with their resistance. He swore that the Knights of Saint John should follow the standard of the prophet, even if it should cost him the half of Egypt. He had a daughter handsome, chaste, accomplished, and every way worthy to follow a better faith; he sent her to the dungeon where the French knights were languishing in fetters, and charged her to set before them a frightful picture of the punishments prepared for them.</p><p>The knights received the princess with those testimonies of respect which were at that time lavished upon ladies; but they repelled her insinuations with the resolute courage of men who accept of martyrdom, and explained to her their belief in a manner so persuasive that the Muslim lady betook herself to serious reflection on Christ and His Blessed Mother.</p><p>A miraculous and resplendent image of Mary, Our Lady of Liesse, which, it is said, was brought by angels to the pious champions of the Christian faith, completed the conversion of the young infidel. One night, when she had gained over the guards of the three French warriors by bribes of gold, she made her way into their prison with a casket full of precious stones, and made her escape with them from her father's palace.</p><p>After passing the Nile in a boat prepared for their reception, the fugitives directed their course towards Alexandria, hoping, perhaps, to conceal themselves for a time in the Coptic monasteries of the desert of Saint Macarius. But, after marching for some hours, the princess, exhausted with fatigue, wished to rest for a little while, and, in spite of the imminent danger, the three knights of Saint John, determined to keep good guard, made her sit down in a field of doura in full verdure, and seated themselves at a respectful distance. The princess fell asleep, and her travelling companions, after struggling in vain against the drowsiness which followed long nights without rest, slept soundly also.</p><p>No one knows how long their slumber continued. The knight of Eppes, the eldest of the three, was the first who awoke; the sun was beginning to gild the tops of the trees, where he heard the sweet singing of birds. The crusader looked at the landscape with great surprise: he had gone to sleep in sight of the Nile and the pyramids, under the fan-like branches of a palm-tree, and he awoke beneath an oak, with knotty branches, on the margin of a clear spring, on the freshest turf, sprinkled with white daisies.</p><p>A short distance off, the round and dark towers of an old baronial castle reminded him of the manor where he had left his mother, all in tears at his departure for the Holy Land. A shepherd, who was driving his sheep to the fields, relieved him of his perplexity; the castle which he beheld was in fact his own castle of Marchais, and he awoke in Picardy, beneath the avenue which his fathers had planted. He blessed the Holy Virgin, and awakened his companions, whose astonishment was as great as his own.</p><p>They had preserved the image of the oriental Madonna; they built a handsome church to receive Our Lady of Liesse, and the Muslim princess received baptism in the cathedral of Leon.</p><p>We may innocently believe that this little statue of Mary came into France by more natural means; but what it is impossible to doubt is, that it was brought from the Holy Land by three great men of Eppes, knights of Saint John of Jerusalem.</p><p>The most illustrious names of the monarchy figure in the list of pilgrims to Our Lady of Liesse. We read there those of the Duke of Burgundy, Louis II of Bourbon, Prince of Conde, Duke of Mercoeur, of Prince Albert Hermy of Ligne, of Madam Henrietta Frances of France, Queen of England, of the princes of Longueville, of Marshal D'Ancre, of Mademoiselle de Guise, of the Count D'Egmont, of Louis, Duke of Orleans, brother of Charles VI, of Charles VII, of King Rene, Of Louis XI, of Francis I, of Henry II, of Charles IX, of Queen Mary of Medicis, of Louis XIII, of Ann of Austria, of Louis XIV.</p><p>Several of these great personages, not satisfied with leaving rich presents to Our Lady of Liesse, placed their statues there: that of Louis II of Bourbon, Prince of Conde, was of gold. Mary D'Arquin, then grand Marshal of Poland, and who was afterwards queen of that kingdom, came to the chapel of Our Lady in 1671; she offered to the Blessed Virgin a child in silver, representing the Prince Alexander Sobieski, her son, with a golden chain enriched with diamonds, to testify that she devoted him to the Mother of God, as her slave.</p><p>This sanctuary was pillaged like the others by the Protestants; the Revolution came to glean whatever was left.</p><p>The chapel of Our Lady of Liesse still attracts, at the present day, a great concourse of pilgrims.</p>"

Only a short drive from Cannes, it is completely surrounded by dense forests, and there are a variety of tall pines and other trees growing amidst the town's buildings. Like so many other places in Europe, the village was once also surrounded by a stone wall set with strong towers, though most of those walls have long since fallen down. Many of the charming older residences, however, are still in use opposite to newer dwellings.</p><p>It was sometime during the 11th century when a local nobleman gave the hill which overlooks the village to the monks to Saint Honorat, who cared for the local populace until the time of the French Revolution. The monks built a chapel on the hill known as Saint Marie, though very little of that original structure still remains. The Chapel of Our Lady of Life, or Notre Dame de Vie in French, was built in 1646, and stands upon the former site of that much earlier church.</p><p>If one were to visit the hermitage of Notre Dame de Vie, Our Lady of Life, they would find it situated on a beautiful site still overlooking the village, set in a long meadow bordered by two rows of giant cypresses. There is a natural peace and quietude that seems to invade the soul at this place, which was once a site of many miracles.</p><p>The name of the first chapel was changed from Saint Mary to Notre Dame de Vie, Our Lady of Life, when it was discovered that one could find a heavenly respite there. Notre Dame de Vie soon became famous throughout the area as a special sanctuary of grace, for if still-born babies were brought there, they would be miraculously brought back to life long enough to be baptized during the Mass.</p><p>\"At the present day, the chapel has fallen to ruin, and a stone cross broken in half rises alone amid the ruins; but underneath these ruins there are subterraneous valuts, and a stone altar yet tells where they still come to lay those little chilren whom death has smitten on the threshold of life, and who have been unable to receive the sacred sign which would have made them like unto the angels.\"</p><p>\"No sooner are they laid upon this stone, says the mountaineer who serves as a guide to the traveller in this dark crypt, than their eyes open again, a slight breathing escapes from their little lips closed by death, the water of baptism flows upon their foreheads, and then they fall asleep again, to ascend to heaven.\"</p><p>\"By digging a little into the ground, the remains of these poor little flowers of humanity, which withered at the icy breath of death in the first hour of their morning, are found round about the altar dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, who raises up the little children to life, that they may go to Jesus Christ; that ignorant, but exalted tenderness of feeling which came to beg the miracle of Mary, interred them beneath her wing, that she might not forget them!\"</p><p>\"Let incredulity be indignant at this superstition of the heart; tender and pious souls will find in it only a motive for gentle commiseration. No doubt, more than one mother has been deceived in thinking that she saw the cold lips of her child become reanimated with her kisses to receive the sacred water; but whoever should dare to advance that Mary cannot perform miracles as great when she pleases, would be, to say the truth, a bold mortal.\" (*from Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with the History of Devotion to Her, by Mathieu Orsini, translated from the French.)</p><p>The chapel is home to an ancient statue in polychrome wood of the Virgin and Child. It is piously believed that through this image the Blessed Virgin has often restored to life children who had died without baptism.</p><p>In 1730 the practice was prohibited for unknown reasons. There is a tomb in an adjacent enclosure that contains the remains of the tiny bodies of those who were baptized and have passed to paradise.</p>"

One day as this lady knelt in prayer, she beheld approaching her, the Queen of Heaven, surrounded by pomp, majesty and glory, surpassing anything else she had ever beheld in any of her visions. A torrent of light was shed from the body of the Virgin which was so clear, that in comparison with it, the sun seemed obscure. Yet, these rays were not painful to the sight; but seemed rather directed to the heart, which they instantly penetrated and filled with sweetness.</p><p>A group of Seraphs hovering in the air were suspended over their Empress and held a triple crown. The virginal body was clothed in a flowing robe, whiter than the snow and more brilliant than the sun. A belt inlaid with precious stones encircled Mary's beautiful form, and from her graceful shoulders hung a mantle of azure hue. Countless angels surrounded their Queen, but what most enchanted the contemplative soul, was the untold sweetness and grace and benignity shown in the motherly face of Mary. She radiated clemency and love. Our Lady told the pious woman that she wished to be represented as she was now under the title of Most Holy Mother of Light, repeating the words three times.</p><p>The Jesuit hired laborers to begin the work on the picture of Our Lady of Light, however neither the pious lady nor the priest were able to direct it, and the result was that after completion, it did not answer Our Lady's orders. Our Lady directed the woman to look at the image, and seeing the mistake, she again betook herself to prayer and asked Mary to help her. Mary appeared again, commanding the woman to supervise the work, giving directions, while Mary would aid in an invisible manner. Pleased by the finished work, Mary appeared over it, and blessed it with the sign of the cross.</p><p>This wonderful treasure is now in the city of Mexico in the cathedral of Leon, formerly known as the Jesuit Church. The back of the picture bears the authenticity and four signatures, including that of Father Genovesi, SJ. The painting was transferred from Palermo, Sicily, in 1702, and placed on the altar in Leon in 1732. The people of Leon have an innate devotion and great tenderness toward the Mother of God. In 1849 they solemnly promised before the picture to make Our Lady of Light the patroness of Leon. This promise was confirmed by Pope Pius IX; Leo XIII authenticated the crowning of the image of Our Lady of Light in 1902.</p>"

Each year the town celebrates its patron saint, Our Lady of Virtues, on the 5th Sunday after Easter. The portrait of the Blessed Virgin has been at Ligny since 1459, and the year 2009 marked its 550th anniversary. The history of the painting of Our Lady of Virtues, or Our Lady of Ligny, and the town of Ligny-en-Barrois, are closely interlinked.</p><p>The portrait is a silk painting unlike any other portrait of the Blessed Virgin. It was originally known to be in the possession of Pope Urban IV, but after many wanderings, the pious image was given to the canons of the collegiate church of Ligny in the year 1459 by Antoine de la Salle, the tutor of the son of Count Louis I of Luxembourg.</p><p>During the war between Francis I and Charles V, the Count Antoine de Luxembourg was allied to the King of France. Ligny was besieged, stormed and destroyed on June 29, 1544. The Holy Image of Our Lady of Ligny was stolen by an Imperial trooper, (actually a German mercenary), but it was retrieved by a laborer and returned in grand procession in 1581. This procession was led by the Countess Margaret of Savoy, who built a new monastery for the Capuchins over the ruins of the previous site. She also began the devotion to the portrait known as Our Lady of Virtues.</p><p>During the French Revolution Church property was confiscated as at every other place. The church at Ligny was sold in 1791 and then destroyed. During the Terror, however, the painting was hidden by two councilors. The painting was restored to its proper place when the revolution died down. In 1814, during the \"Campaign of France,\" the town of Ligny was again besieged. A thousand young soldiers defended the town against odds of ten to one. Their bravery did not stop the town from being taken and eventually looted, but at least the homes were not destroyed despite the best efforts of the Prussian artillerymen. In a statement attributed to Canon Souhaut, it is recorded that: \"The protection of the sky over the city seemed indisputable so that even the Prussians attributed the futility of their efforts to set artillery fire to the town to the miraculous image of Our Lady of Ligny.\" This protection seemed to continue through World War I, as, according to some, Our Lady of Virtues protected the city through four separate bombings that caused no deaths.</p>"

A number of lamps, of massive silver, burn before it.</p><p>The beautiful litany of Our Lady of Loreto was the votive offering with which a celebrated Florentine composer, of the early years of the eighteenth century, repaid a miracle of the Blessed Virgin. This composer, whose name was Barroni, all at once lost his hearing, like Beethoven; after having exhausted the succor of art without success, he invoked that of Mary, and set out on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Loreto. There he was cured, after praying with faith, and in his gratitude to the Holy Madonna, he composed, by inspiration, in her praise, a chorus, which, under the title of Litanie della Santa Casa, was performed for the first time on the 15th of August, 1737. This litany was repeated every year afterwards for the feast of the Madonna; Rossini, happening to pass by Our Lady of Loreto, was struck with the charm of this composition, and is said to have introduced it into his Tancredi (Gazette Musicale).</p><p>The front area of the church was constructed during the pontificate of Pope Sixtus V in 1586, and it was he who founded the order of Knights of Loreto, who were a company of knights especially devoted to defend the shores of the Italian Mediterranean against the incursions of barbarians.</p><p>The popes have delighted to testify their respect for Mary, by making her miraculous sanctuary of Loreto the object of their devout solicitude. Pope Pius V offered to the Santa Casa two silver statues of Saints Peter and Paul; he did still better by diverting from its natural channel a river, the waters of which, sluggish and in great measure stagnant, sent up the most unwholesome exhalations to the top of the hill, where a small town has been formed, under the shadow of the magnificent church of Mary.</p><p>Pope Benedict XIV, embellished this sanctuary with truly persevering generosity, where Pius VII, having recovered his liberty, came to kneel, before his entrance into Rome, and where he left, as a memorial of his visit, a superb gold chalice, with this inscription: \"Pius VII, sovereign pontiff, restored to liberty on the day of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and coming from France to Rome, left at Loretto this monument of his devotion and gratitude.\" His holiness Gregory XVI also made a pilgrimage to Loreto.</p>"

The church takes its name from Nicetius of Lyon, who was the 28th bishop there in the 6th century, due to the numerous miracles that occurred there after his burial.</p><p>In 1186 the Canons of the Cathedral started building a larger church over the shrine. In thanksgiving for the cure of his son by this Saint, King Louis VII of France made a pilgrimage to Lyons, where he had an ex-voto tablet set up before the shrine of Our Lady. In 1466 King Louis XI founded a daily Mass in perpetuity, to be followed always by the Salve Regina, solemnly sung.</p><p>Vast Pilgrimages came to seek Mary's aid especially in time of famine and plague. During the plague of 1643, it was decided to dedicate the city to Our Lady.

Originally known as Saint Mary of the Vows, the painting is crowned today.</p><p>According to tradition, the history of the site dates back to Saint Anselm. At that time the Blessed Virgin had promised her protection for the city. Starting in 1477, word spread that before the image numerous miracles had occurred, so that by then substantial offerings began to pour into the church (hence the name of Santa Maria dei Voti).</p><p>After the plague of 1630, which had overwhelmed the city and its territory, the princess Maria Gonzaga, regent of the duchy, wanted to entrust herself, her dynasty, and the state to the protection of the Blessed Virgin. The princess was determined to place herself, her son Charles II and the states of Mantua and of Monferrate under the special protection of Mary. She ordered that the image of Mary should be carried in procession through the streets of the city, and desired that the image be solemnly crowned in the Basilica of Saint Andrea, as the Queen of Mantua.</p><p>The solemn crowning of Our Lady commonly called Santa Maria dei Voti was strongly urged by the pious princess Maria Gonzaga in the year 1640, when the dam of the Po River in Italy broke.

    "Our Lady of Marienthal": {
        "eng": "<p>Marienthal is located perhaps an hour from the city of Hagenau, and is one of the many famous places of pilgrimage in the Alsace region of France. Our Lady of Marienthal has been visited by pilgrims for many centuries, and an old chronicle tells of wonderful miracles that were granted on behalf of many of the believers who visited the ancient church. The benevolent Virgin Mary obtained grace there for all of the afflicted, and when sinners called upon her for assistance they would inevitably find comfort and mercy. There was no pain which was not relieved, no accident that was not mended, not a hope that was disappointed. The crippled and lame could pray there in that time and return home healed, leaving their crutches behind in the church. The blind were illuminated and regained their sight, and the deaf heard again. Mothers obtained the health of their children; young people who had lost their peace of mind through sin found forgiveness and regained their peace of mind; sailors in the dangers of the sea and the soldiers in the bloody battle called upon the assistance of the loving mother of Marienthal, and never in vain.</p><p>The church remained open day and night so that the pilgrims at any hour could have access to grace through Our Lady of Marienthal, but this practice also provided an opportunity for robbery attempts. Mary protected her home, and left no thief of church property free to run. As an example, it happened once that a thief was alone in the church shortly before daybreak, and beholding a beautiful jewel upon the altar that had been left as a gift, stretched forth his hand to steal it. As he did so, a supernatural force held him in place until the monks from the monastery, which stood near the church, came and found him later in the morning. He was promptly delivered to the courts in Hagenau for punishment.</p><p>When the heresy of Martin Luther penetrated the Alsace, anything that was sacred to Catholics was ridiculed and persecuted as a consequence. Pilgrims were set upon, and Marienthal was threatened with destruction. In many places the altars of Catholic churches were already smashed, and the images of the saints cast down; the same fate seemed about to befall the church at Marienthal.</p><p>The devout Catholics decided to hide two miraculous paintings, as well as the statue of the Sorrowful Mother with the child Jesus in her arms, from the predatory hands of the new iconoclasts. They were taken in secret to the monastery for safekeeping. A concurrent document states that the statue of the Sorrowful Virgin shed copious tears while on the way, which was seen by all those present. The statue and paintings were returned to the church once the initial threat had passed, but the pilgrims to Marienthal were much less numerous, as they were often derided by the Protestants, and mistreated as godless blasphemers.</p><p>A new persecution broke out in 1569 as enemy soldiers roamed the Alsace and devastated it. Marienthal was also exposed to their devastations to a great extent. At that time a woman named Hochstatter wanted to prevent the desecration of the Holy images, and decided once again to transport them to Hagenau.</p><p>\"With this intent,\" tells the Chronicle, \"she came into the church of the Blessed Virgin, ascended a ladder and took the statue of the Sorrowful Virgin on her shoulders and went on her way.\" She had acted out of zeal, but the statue of the Mother of God was far too heavy, and her knees staggered as she inevitably sank to the ground beneath her burden. Following a momentary inspiration, the woman knelt next to the image and pleaded with a trusting heart to Mary:</p><p>\"O, my Heavenly Mother! Please ask thy Divine Son to increase my strength, or else decrease the severity of this precious load so that I may take it to safety.\" After finishing her prayer, the woman took up the image again on her shoulder and easily carried it the rest of the way to Hagenau.</p><p>From this time on the church at Marienthal was closed and abandoned. Soon, it was no longer possible even to kneel down next to the degraded walls, as the heretics who roved around in the neighboring woods mistreated all the Catholics that they could get their hands on. These conditions continued until the end of the sixteenth century when the Jesuits came and awakened the old beliefs and reopened the church at Marienthal. Not only did they return the church to its former glory, but they exterminated the heresy in considerable parts of the Alsace.</p><p>But a new storm broke out because of the French Revolution. Two priests and some pious women, working together at the risk of their lives, took the wonderful images from the church, as well as the consecrated vessels and other ornaments of the church, to Ottersweier, a village on the right bank of the Rhine. They remained there until the restoration of Catholic worship. Meanwhile, Marienthal was occupied by German troops who had invaded Alsace. The soldiers used the church as a barracks.</p><p>The sacred images were finally restored in 1803 via a triumphal procession from Ottersweier to Marientha. The clergy were followed by the entire population of Hagenau who were flying colorful flags and burning candles in the solemn procession. The Bishop of Strasbourg celebrated a Pontifical High Mass, inaugurating a day of celebration that is still continued annually on the first Sunday of June.</p><p>Since that time, Marienthal is once again visited as frequently as ever, especially on the feast days of Our Lady. The pious crowd rushes to the enlarged and embellished church, whose choir walls are entirely covered with votive offerings. Most young Alsatian and Lorraine soldiers go to the church at Marienthal before they begin their service to implore the protection of the Blessed Virgin. Even today you can see the parents of those who miraculously escaped death in battles and engagements kneeling before the altar to thank God and to read their thanks aloud. Even many Protestants, sensible to the example of the faithful and the reports of miracles that are worked at the site, send their names in secret in the hands of pious persons to Marienthal, asking them to pray and offer gifts for them.</p>"

A chapel of the Blessed Virgin was built in the seventh century, and in the year 1119 Saint William of Vercelli founded the monastery that still exists high up on the mountains. Saint William was a hermit who came back to his native Italy after making a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela in Spain.</p><p>Due to Saint William's reputation for sanctity, many men were drawn to him and soon there were many cells located on the mountain. The first true church was constructed in 1126, and was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin.</p><p>In the church is a large icon of the Mother and Child, \"of Constantinople\" (said to have been brought to Italy by King Baldwin of Jerusalem) which came into the possession of the monastery in 1310. King Baldwin was only able to take away the upper portion of the large image. The dark figures on the icon of Our Lady of Montevergine stand out strikingly from the gold background; the present lower part of the picture is a later addition.</p><p>The image is quite large, with a height of over 12 feet and width of over 6 feet, showing the Blessed Virgin seated on a throne with the Divine Infant Jesus seated on her lap. The image is dark, so the icon is often referred to as one of the \"Black Madonnas.\" There have apparently been several renovations made to the original painting, as in 1621 two crowns were placed on the heads of the Virgin Mary and her child Jesus, and other additions were made in 1712 and 1778.</p><p>During World War II the church was used to hide the famed Holy Shroud of Turin, the burial cloth of Christ. A new basilica was begun in 1952 in the Romanesque style, and this structure was consecrated in 1961. There are over one and one half million pilgrims yearly who come to Monte Vergine to visit Our Lady of Montevergine, most notably at Whitsuntide. There have been numerous miracles attributed to this portrait of the Mother of God and her Divine Son.</p><p>There is a church at Seattle, Washington, dedicated in honor of Monte Vergine, Our Lady of the Mount, and another at New Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>"

It is a mountain standing alone, ten leagues from Barcelona, which was, according to the celebrated naturalist Humboldt, the great Atlas of the ancients, at the foot of which the fine kingdom of Valencia displayed the golden apples of the garden of the Hesperides. This mountain, which owed its name of Monte Serrats (sawed mountain) to its extraordinary form, seems as if composed of inlaid work, which makes it look as if divided and covered with spiral cones, or pine cones; so that it appears, from afar, to have been the work of men.</p><p>At a distance, Montserrat is a pile of grottoes and Gothic pyramids; when near, each cone appears a mountain by itself; and all the cones, terminated by needles, or points, which make a great noise when the wind blows, form an enormous mass of about five leagues in circumference. It was probably this singular conformation that led to the invention of the fable of the giants, who had heaped mountain upon mountain to scale the heavens.</p><p>It is on a platform of his celebrated mountain that the superb convent has been built, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, which is one of the most celebrated pilgrimages of Christendom. An inscription, of the year 1239, preserved in the convent above a large picture of the same period, thus records the foundation of this fine monastery:</p><p>\"In the year 808, under the government of the Count of Barcelona, Geoffry le Velu, three young shepherds having one night seen a great light descend from the sky, and heard melodious music in the air, informed their relations of it. The bailiff and the Bishop of Mauresa having repaired, with all these people, to the spot which they pointed out, saw likewise the light from heaven, and after some search, they discovered the image of the Blessed Virgin, which they wanted to remove to Mauresa; but, being come to the place where the monastery now stands, they could not advance any farther. This prodigy induced the Count of Barcelona to build a convent of women there, from which he took the nuns of the royal abbey of Las Puellas of Barcelon; the first abbess of Our Lady of Montserrat was his daughter Richilda, who took possession of it about the year 895. This community of nuns subsisted until about the year 976, when the Count of Barcelona, Borrell, with the consent of the pope, placed Benedictine monks at Montserrat.\"</p><p>The convent of Montserrat is a grand and noble edifice, situated on a platform very confined, and projecting from the mountain, which bears the name of Saint Mary's platform; enormous rocks project above it, which seem every moment ready to fall; it is defended by the steep points of the mountain, as by natural fortifications, and on the accessible side by six strong towers. Besides the church of Our Lady, the fortified enclosure contains a house of entertainment for travelers, a hospital, and an infirmary.The church of Our Lady of Montserrat his only a nave, but is nevertheless very spacious; the stalls of the choir are of very remarkable workmanship. The image of the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Montserrat, has a face almost black, like those of Toledo and Guadeloupe, and many others which are visited in Spain; it is painted all over, and represented in an advanced age; though very brown, the face is graceful: she is seated on a seat made in the form of a throne, and holds in her right had a globe, from which springs a fleur de lis, while she supports with the other hand the Infant Jesus, seated on her lap, giving a blessing with his right hand, and holding in the other a globe, surmounted by a cross.</p><p>The inhabitants of the mountain, divided into four classes, namely, monks, hermits, choristers, and lay brothers, succeed each other uninterruptedly in their prayers. The arrangement of the places is such, that from several of the hermitages the chanting of the monastery is heard, and the sound of the bells of the different hermits, repeated by the echoes, is united in the turnings and anfractuousness of the mountains. From the summit of Montserrat, the kingdoms of Valentia and Murcia are seen, and even as far as the Belaric Isles, which forms the finest prospect in the world.</p><p>Princes and kings of Spain often climbed on foot the steep path which leads to the altar of Our Lady of Montserrat, and innumerable captives came there to hang up the chains which they had worn among the Moors. Saint Ignatius of Loyola, before he devoted his life to religion, came thither to watch his arms, according to the usages and customs of that old chivalry, of which his head was then full.</p><p>After passing the night in prayer, and solemnly dedicating himself to Our Lady of Montserrat as her knight, according to the warlike ideas which he still had in his mind, and under which he conceived the things of God, says F. Bouhours, his historian, he hung up his sword on a pillar near the altar, in token of his renunciation of secular warfare; then, after communicating early in the morning, he left Montserrat.</p>"

The legends date from the ninth century when it is believed the hermits who dwelt in caves kept watch over a tiny chapel known as Santa Maria de Montserrat. Reliable documents have it that a great monastic center was founded among the same cliffs in the eleventh century and that a small black statue of the Madonna drew the kings of Aragon, the monarchs of Spain, Emperor Charles V, saints, and celebrities, as well as common folks to the difficult mountain.

The popes John XXII, Gregory XIII, Sixtus V, Gregory XIV, and Clement VIII, have granted indulgences to those who are of this confraternity.</p><p>Nine centuries before Christ the great prophet Elias went to the heights of Carmel to beg God to send rain after three and a half years of drought. In answer to his prayers Elias saw a small cloud rise out of the sea, a promise of the Immaculate Virgin mother whose Son would save mankind from the scourge of sin.</p><p>At the time of the Crusades there were hermits living on Mt. Carmel in imitation of Elias. In their midst was a chapel dedicated to Our Lady. To the medieval members of the Order, Mary was the Gracious Lady who protected them from danger, who won for them the favor of Christ, her Son.</p><p>The one gift that unites all Catholics to Our Blessed Lady of Mount Carmel is her scapular. The scapular was given to Saint Simon Stock, prior general of the Camelite Order, on July 16, 1251. Our Lady appeared to the Saint when there was great danger that her order would perish. The works of Saint Simon was the prayer, Flower of Carmel, still said daily by Carmelites:</p><p><center>\"Flower of Carmel, Vine, Blossom-laden,</p><p>Splendor of Heaven, Childbearing maiden,</p><p>None equals thee.</p><p>O Mother benign who no man didst know,</p><p>On all Carmel's children Thy favors bestow,</p><p>Star of the Sea.\"</p></center><p>The Blessed Mother answered Simon's prayers by giving him the scapular, telling him: \"Receive this habit, this shall be a sign of salvation. Whosoever dies clothed in this shall not suffer eternal fire.\"</p><p>Seven centuries have shown what a generous gift Our Mother gave us when she made for us the garment of her scapular. German Catholics call the scapular Mary's \"garment of grace.\" Mary's habit is a humble garment, simply two pieces of cloth joined by strings. Yet, we do not measure God's gifts by ordinary standards. The very simplicity of the scapular is a lesson in modesty and purity. The Queen of Heaven has made the scapular the pledge of her protection, especially at the hour of death. Our mother has clothed us, her children, with her garment of choice. Wearing it, we show that we have dedicated ourselves completely to her service, and are reminded to imitate our Mother. The continual wearing of it is a prayer for Mary's protection, a sign of our complete dependence on her.</p><p>The second promise Mary made is known as the Sabbatine Privilege  -  Saturday, because Our Lady promised scapular-wearers who perform certain additional acts in her honor prompt delivery from Purgatory, especially on the Saturday after death. We believe that God grants all graces through His Mother. Mary showed herself to Bernadette at Lourdes for the last time on July 16; in her last vision at Fatima, she appeared as Our Lady of Mount Carmel. When we were enrolled in the scapular, the following prayer was said: \"May Almighty God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, bless you whom he has been pleased to receive into the Confraternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel. We beg her to crush the head of the ancient serpent in the hour of your death, and in the end obtain for you the palm and crown of your everlasting inheritance. Amen.\"</p>"

It was restored in the 12th century in the Romanesque style, and again in the 16th century in a more Gothic style.</p><p>An ancient tradition records that a lord of the country, the Duke de Blacas, who was also a Knight of Saint John of the Hospital, had been captured by the Turks during a Crusade.

Saint Jerome later gave it to Saint Augustine in Africa, to protect the statue by removing it from the Holy Land. Saint Augustine then gave it into the safekeeping of the monastery of Cauliniana, near Merida, a monastery on the Iberian Peninsula.</p><p>When the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula in the year 711, King Roderic met them with his Visigothic army at the battle of Guadalete, where he was soundly defeated.</p><p>It is a fact of history that the body of Roderic was never found upon the field of battle, although his horse was found, and it is often assumed by historians that Roderic died that day when he lost his kingdom.

Alone and unknown, he made his way to the monastery of Cauliniana where he sought shelter for the night. Going to confession, he of necessity revealed his true identity to the friar, Frei Romano. As it turned out, the monks were preparing to leave the monastery in advance of the Arabs, and so Frei Romano asked the king if he could accompany him in his travels. Roderic agreed, and the friar took with him the statue of Our Lady of Nazareth and the relics of Saint Bras and Saint Bartholomew.</p><p>They traveled together until they arrived at a place later named Monte de Saint Bartolomeu in November of the year 714. They made for themselves a hermitage with the friar living in a small cave at the edge of a cliff that overlooked the sea. He placed the image in a niche among the stones upon a pedestal of simple rocks. Roderic went a little ways off by himself to a hill where he also began to live the life of a hermit. After a year, though, King Roderic left the hermitage, and nothing else is said of him in this legend. One wonders if he ever learned of his kinsman Pelayo, who had retreated into the mountains and continued to heroically defy the invaders.</p><p>Before his death, Frei Romano hid the image in his small cave, where it remained undisturbed for some centuries until it was discovered by shepherds, who came there to venerate the statue. Inside that little, ancient sanctuary they had found the renowned and sacred image of Our Lady of Nazareth. Carved of wood, it was unlike any other statue of the Madonna they had ever seen, for it depicts the Blessed Virgin breastfeeding her Divine Child while seated upon a simple bench. When miracles began to frequently occur, it became a major pilgrimage center.</p><p>Then, in the early morning of September 14th in the year 1182, the mayor of Porto de Mos, Dom Fuas Roupinho, was hunting on his land when he observed a deer. Chasing it up a steep slope on horseback that misty morning, the fog became heavier all of a sudden. The deer, later suspected to be the devil in the guise of a deer, jumped off the edge of the hilltop into the empty void. Despite his efforts to stop his horse, the spirited mount was determined to follow after the deer. Helpless to save himself, the rider suddenly recognized that he was near the sacred grotto where he would often come to pray. Fuas Roupinho cried out to the Blessed Virgin, praying aloud: \"Our Lady, Help Me!\"</p><p>The horse stopped immediately, as if he were digging his hooves into the rocky cliff above the void. Suspended in an unnatural manner at the edge of the cliff, Fuas Rouphinho knew the drop to be over 100 meters, and surely would mean his death if he had fallen. He was then able to back slowly away from the edge, looking down to see the evidence of the impossible and unimaginable - for there in the hard stone was the imprint of one of his horse's hooves. One of those marks can still be seen in the native rock.</p><p>Faus Rouphinho dismounted and went to the grotto to pray and give thanks, subsequently causing a chapel 'Capela da Memoria,' or 'The Chapel of Remembrance,' to be built very near the spot where his life had been miraculously saved. When the masons he had hired took apart the primitive altar in the cave, they found an ivory box of sorts that contained the relics of Saint Bras and Saint Bartholomew. There was also an ancient scroll that they carefully removed.</p><p>Opening the scroll, they found that it explained the history of the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary and her Divine Child, now known as Our Lady of Nazareth, as outlined above.</p><p>The church Santuario de Nossa Senhora da Nazare was later built on the hilltop overlooking Nazare by King Ferdinand I of Portugal in the year 1377. Its construction was necessary due to the large number of pilgrims who continued to come to venerate the image. Over the years it was often rebuilt, or had additions made, especially in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The profusely decorated and gilded apse displays the statue of Nossa Senhora da Nazare in a lighted niche above the main altar, flanked by twisted columns.</p><p>The first King of Portugal, Don Afonso Henriques, as well as the chief nobles of his court, were among the early pilgrims to the shrine. Many notable figures came to visit Our Lady of Nazareth throughout history, including Vasco de Gama, who came as a pilgrim before setting out for India, and Pedro Alvares Cabral, who later discovered Brazil. St Francis Xavier, the Apostle of the East, went on pilgrimage to Our Lady of Nazareth before later leaving for Goa.</p><p>According to a plaque placed in the chapel in 1623, the image was carved by Saint Joseph in Galilee when Jesus was a baby. Some decades later St Luke the Evangelist painted the faces and hands of the images. It remained in Nazareth until brought by the Greek monk Ciriaco to the Iberian Peninsula. It is believed to be one of the oldest images venerated by Christians.</p>"

    "Our Lady of Oegnies": {
        "eng": "<p>Oegnies, also spelled Oignies and known as Ongniacume in ancient times, is a village located in the north of France. It is thought to be the birthplace of Saint Mary of Oegnies, who visited the holy image of Our Lady of Oegnies once every year, even walking barefoot to the shrine during the severe rigors of winter. Saint Mary of Oegnies was beatified by the Church, and her feast day is June 23rd. It is said that the Virgin Mary once sheltered her from the rain with her mantle. Saint Mary of Oegnies was born at Nivelles in 1167, and died on June 23rd, 1213, of natural causes.</p><p>Mary was born into a wealthy family. Very early in life she felt the call to the consecrated life. According to tradition the beginning of her conversion came about due to her contemplation of the Cross and Passion of Christ. Meditating on the Passion one day she was so moved to tears that her steps in church might be traced by the copious drops that fell on the paves. Many who observed her also felt moved to devotion, reading in her countenance as in a book the unction of the Holy Ghost.</p><p>Despite her wishes, Mary's parents desired for her to marry and arranged a marriage for her at the age of 14. Mary was obedient, but convinced her husband, John, to live chastely with her as brother and sister. They gave what they had to the poor, and for many years she and her husband served lepers in a hospital at Willenbrouch near Nivelle.</p><p>Mary was greatly devoted to Our Lady of Oegnies and Saint John the Evangelist, and was a friend to a woman known as Christina the Astonishing, a remarkable woman who truly merited her name. Having apparently died while in her early 20's, Christina came back to life and levitated from her casket during her funeral ceremony to tell those present that God had shown her Heaven, Hell and Purgatory, and that she had returned to do penance for the relief of the dead and the conversion of sinners. These penances included casting herself into furnaces from which she would later emerge unharmed, and allowing wild dogs to tear and rend her flesh until she was covered with her own blood, only then to immediately heal with no trace of wound or scar.</p><p>Eventually unable to bear the frequent attention of devotees, Mary and her husband felt it God's will that they should separate to live contemplative lives. Mary retired to a hermitage of Saint Nicholas in Oignies, near Namur. There she prayed for the souls in Purgatory, and gave spiritual advise to the disciples who gathered around her, among them James of Viry. She practiced asceticism worthy of the Desert Fathers, and was privileged to have mystical ecstasies and visions, mainly of Saint John and her guardian angel. Mary also continued to care for lepers.</p><p>Three days before she died, Mary began to sing in ecstatic strains in the Romance language concerning the Trinity, the Humanity of Christ, the Virgin and the Saints. She sang as if the sentences with their rhythm were written before her. She said, greatly rejoicing at it, that the Holy Spirit would soon visit His Church, and send laborers more abundantly than usual into the harvest.</p><p>There is the so-called Treasure of Oignies, which consists of thirty reliquaries, crosses, and other precious items dating from the 13th century, and together they are considered one of the Seven Wonders of Belgium. The Treasure of Oignies is the work of an exceptional jeweler, brother Hugo d'Oignies, and is one of the most important heritage treasures with which Belgium is enriched. Made in the priory of Oignies-sur-Sambre between the years 1228 and 1238, they escaped as by miracle from the French revolutionaries who destroyed the monastery in the year 1796.</p>"

Yet the shrine is certainly an old one, and throughout the Middle Ages was associated with a Community of Canon Regulars.</p><p>The vast range of buildings, there today was begun by the dukes of Savoy, early in the seventeenth century, and forms one of the most complete pilgrimage centers in the world (there is even a cinema theater).

While in exile, the Emperor Constantine permitted him some freedom. Eusebius discovered among some ruins in Jerusalem three statues of Our Lady. On his triumphant return after the Arians had been temporarily overthrown, he gave two of the statues away. The third he kept for himself, placing it in a little hermitage at Oropa which he often visited.</p><p>In the 5th and 6thcenturies when Arianism again reared its ugly head, the faithful Catholics took refuge at the shrine of Our Lady of Oropa.</p><p>At one time it was decided to transport the statue to another place. As the procession marched along, the statue became so heavy that the men who carried it could not move on. Only when they decided to take Our Lady back to her original shrine at Oropa were they able to move.</p><p>The chapel of Our Lady of Oropa is a beautiful one and thousands of pilgrims today make their way there as they have done over the centuries.</p><p>The Holy See asked the authorities in 1856 to make a list of the miracles recorded at the shrine.

It rests in the town where King Alfonso II, the Chaste, built a shrine to house it, and there it can be seen even today as it was well over a millennium ago. Like the Arc of the Covenant, or the Holy Grail, it is a singular thing the like of which is almost utterly unknown in the entire history of mankind.</p><p>This Holy Chest is made of oak and was skillfully constructed without the use of any nails. It measures roughly four feet by three feet by two feet, and has been venerated by faithful Catholics since apostolic times. Indeed, it is believed to have been fashioned by devoted disciples of the twelve apostles. Many men and woman throughout history have given their entire lives in service to the holy relics contained therein, or to save the chest from pagans who sought its destruction.</p><p>The chest originated in the Holy City of Jerusalem. When the Persain's attacked and conquered Jerusalem in 614, many priceless relics from the region were gathered and placed in it for protection, as the Persians sought relics to destroy them. The chest was taken for safekeeping to a small community of Catholics in Alexandria, Egypt. A short time later, Alexandria was also sacked by the Muslims, and the chest was taken across the Mediterranean Sea to Spain, where St. Isidore kept it in Seville. Upon St. Isidore's death, the chest was transferred to the city of Toledo, which was then becoming an important center in Spain. When the wave of Muslim aggression reached even Toledo in 711, the Holy Chest was taken to the Asturias and hidden in a well in Pelayo's mountain.</p><p>The chest has a lock and key, but by the time of the eleventh century it had not been opened for hundreds of years. The last time it was known to have been opened was when it was done by a living saint, St. Ildephonsus, for in it he had placed a chasuble that the Mother of God herself had given him during an apparition.</p><p>By the year 1030, the exact contents of the Holy Chest were no longer known. Bishop Ponce of Oviedo, and with him many clerics, determined to examine the chest to unlock its secrets. As soon as the lid was raised only the slightest bit, \"there burst forth so stupendous a light that the terrified clerics, some of them stricken stone-blind, dropped the lid and fled, leaving the mystery unsolved.\"</p><p>After Mass, on Friday, March 13, 1075, the key was again placed in the lock. On this occasion, God was pleased to reveal the contents of the Holy Chest. The chest contained the Sudarium, mentioned by St. John the Evangelist in his Gospel as the cloth that covered the face of Christ after the crucifixion. On it can be seen the bloodstains of Our Lord that evidence his passion and death. It alone is a treasure without reckoning\u2026</p><p>The chest also contained a piece of the True Cross of Our Lord, a small stone of the sepulcher in which He was buried, some of the cloths in which He was wrapped in the manger, several thorns from the Crucifixion, a piece of the earth of Mount Olivet touched by His feet when He ascended into heaven, one of the thirty coins given to Judas, the chasuble given by the Virgin Mary to Saint Ildephonsus, a chest of gold and precious stones containing the forehead of St. John the Baptist and his hair, and a host of other relics from many saints and prophets, including St. Stephen, the first martyr, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Peter the Apostle, St. Vincent, and the rod of Moses which parted the Red Sea and the manna supplied from heaven during the Exodus from Egypt, and many other priceless relics.</p><p>King Alfonso VI commissioned a silversmith to sheath the Holy Chest in gilded silver, adoring it with figures of Our Lord and His angels and saints.

Some authorities say that veneration of the Blessed Virgin in Paris can be traced to the first apostles of the city. Since Saint Paul was in Gaul (France) during his travels, it may be assumed that this veneration dates to the first century of the Christian era. And if Mary was venerated in Paris at that early date, it is possible that she was, even then, known as Our Lady of Paris. Briefly, as long as Christian minds can be remembered, Paris was consecrated to the Virgin Mary, whom the inhabitants always venerated.</p><p>It is known that Our Lady of Paris was a church first built by King Childebert in the year 522. About the year 1257, the King Saint Louis IX assisted in the construction of a larger church carried on in the same place, on the foundations which King Philip Augustus had laid in the year 1191. The older church built by King Childebert, which had been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, had became too ruinous to be repaired, so Maurice, Bishop of Paris, decided to rebuild it and at the same time adorn Paris with a Cathedral that would outshine all those which had hitherto been built anywhere.</p><p>Plans were drawn up during the reign of King Louis VII, and work had actually begun on Notre Dame de Paris, Notre Dame Cathedral, in 1162. The cornerstone was laid in the presence of Pope Alexander III. Notre Dame is a huge Gothic cathedral on the Ile de la Cite, with beautiful flying buttresses to support the tremendous height of the walls, and are adorned with stylish gargoyles. It is home to a reliquary which contains Christ's Crown of Thorn. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, perhaps 1345, the cathedral was finished, virtually as it stands today. Some time during the building of the Cathedral, a statue of Our Lady was fashioned and installed in place.</p><p>As was typical, the cathedral was desecrated during the French Revolution, and many of the religious artifacts were lost to future generations, although the incredible stain glass windows were not destroyed, including the spectacular \"rose window\" that can still be seen today.</p>"

This occurred on three successive nights, and then, as Our Lady had promised, the sick woman was instantly cured on a Saturday.</p><p>During the visits, Our Lady of Pellevoisin frequently spoke to Estell, her theme being that which she so often has expressed during the past hundred years:</p><p>\"I am all-merciful and have great influence over my Son. What distresses me most is the lack of respect for my Son. Publish my glory.\"</p><p>For some months after her miraculous cure, Estelle continued to live quietly at Pellevoisin. She was at a loss to find the means of fulfilling the mission entrusted to her by Our Lady. Her heavenly visitor, however, was watching over her, and Estelle was to see her again and receive more minute instructions as to what was required of her. On the feast of Our Lady's visitation in the same year, 1876, as Estell was praying in her room, she was granted another vision. Our Lady, robed in white and wearing on her breast a white scapular with the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, appeared to her favored friend. This was the first of a series of wonderful visions enjoyed by Estelle, ten in all. Again and again Mary pointed to the great need for penance and expiation  -  a return to God.</p><p>During one of these apparitions, Our Lady of Pellevoisin, taking her white scapular in her hand, held it before Estelle saying,</p><p>\"I love this devotion.\"</p><p>Immediately Estelle knew that her life's work was to propagate devotion to the Sacred Heart by means of a scapular modeled on Mary's. On her last appearance, December 8th, Our Lady commanded Estelle to approach her Bishop and give him a copy of the new scapular.</p><p>\"Tell him to help you with all his power, and that nothing would be more agreeable to me than to see this badge on each one of my children, in reparation for the outrages that my Son suffers in the Sacrament of His Love. See, the graces I pour upon those who wear it with confidence, and who help to make it known.\"</p><p>The Prelate in question, the Archbishop of Bourges, gave Estelle a favorable hearing and immediately set up a commission to investigate the whole matter. The result of all this was the establishment at Pellevoisin in 1894 by Pope Leo XIII of an Archconfraternity under the title of Mother of Mercy, Our Lady of Pellevoisin. The membership of this Confraternity had gone on increasing year after year, while Pellevoisin itself has become a center of pilgrimages for thousands of Mary's friends.</p><p>Estelle lived her quiet and peaceful life at Pellevoisin, neither desiring nor receiving any personal credit.

And in His fear He turns to His Mother for help.</p><p>What does the loosened sandal mean? All babies manage to kick off their shoes, and the Christ child was a perfectly human baby. There is a meaning in his act, however, for His is more than just a human baby. If it were not for this loosened sandal, the picture would not be a complete one.

This image, which is set up on the front of the church of the suburb of this town, on the side of Rouen, is celebrated for the many miracles which are wrought there.</p><p>The statue of Our Lady of Pontoise is of marble, and stands over 6 feet in height. The Madonna wears a short veil and a dress with long tight sleeves. Our Lady's face is framed by her hair. The Divine Child lays His hands on an orb that His mother holds in her hand.</p><p>The statue was, according to tradition, carved by a pious youth in the quarry at Blangis, near Abbeville and brought to Pontoise. In 1226 the Archbishop of Rouen dedicated a chapel there, and in 1249 it was made a parish church, and the statue was placed outside, over the main entrance. The church was visited by the saint-king, Louis IX; though it did not figure greatly in history until after 1431 when it was destroyed by the English.</p><p>From this time on, the shrine had a violent history. The English, who were at that time still militantly Catholic, determined to rebuild the shrine they had destroyed. It was partly finished when the French reconquered the territory. They finished the rebuilding in 1484.</p><p>During the years of 1580 and 1650, when the plague was destroying the country, people flocked to Our Lady of Pontoise and the danger was averted. Again in 1849 a cholera epidemic was averted through her intercession, so that the shrine had the name of being powerful against plagues.</p><p>In Reformation times a Protestant tried to steal the statue and failing that, knocked off the head of the Infant and threw it into the river. A fisherman had spread his nets just below the bridge and the severed head was saved and returned to the statue.</p><p>In 1585 the church was destroyed again by the English; in 1790 by the revolutionaries. Each time the statue was saved and returned; the last time by a man who bid on it at an auction and kept it in his garden until the troubled days were over. The church was rebuilt in 1800 and a century later was still extant; the yearly thanksgiving procession for Our Lady's protection from the plague was held annually. Replicas of the statue were placed over many doorways of the city after the plague of 1640, and some are still there.</p>"

Mary of Agreda thus:\"My daughter, although in the present life thou canst not penetrate into the mystery of the love which I had and still have for men; yet, in addition to that which thou hast understood, I wish, for they better information, that thou consider again, how the lord has given me the title of Mother and Teacher of the church. With it He infused into my soul an ineffable participation of charity and mercy for the children of Adam. As I was a mere creature and since this blessing was so immense, its effects would have deprived me many times of life, if the divine power had not miraculously sustained me. These effects I felt frequently in my thanksgiving, when souls were received into the Church or were made partakers of the eternal glory; for I alone could know and estimate this happiness in its entirety, and since I realized it, I gave thanks for it to the Almighty with intense fervor and deepest humility.</p><p>But the occasions in which I was affected most deeply, was when I asked for the conversion of sinners and when any of the faithful fell into eternal perdition. At such and other times, experiencing the extreme opposite of my joys, I suffered much more than the martyrs in all their torments. I exerted myself for each soul with an eminent and supernatural force. For all this the children of Adam stand in debt to me, since I offered up for them so many times my own life. Though at present I am not any more in a condition to offer it for them, yet my love, which seeks their eternal salvation, is not diminished, but is more exalted and perfect.\"</p>"

        "eng": "<p>Known now as Notre-Dame-des-Vertus, this is the 14th century church in Aubervilliers that is the very location that experienced so many miracles during the Middle Ages. As noted by the Abbot Orsini, the church was originally dedicated to Saint Christopher, yet the name soon changed to honor the Mother of God in recognition of the graces and miracles obtained there due to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p><p>The first miracle occurred on May 14th, 1336, known locally at the Miracle of Rain. It was during a time of terrible drought when a small girl entered the church of Saint Christopher with flowers to adorn the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. While praying that Our Lady would send rain to save the crops, the girl suddenly noticed that the statue became covered with what appeared to be drops of sweat and the sky turned dark as the weather turned to rain.</p><p>The inhabitants of the parish flocked to the church, alerted by the sound of the church bell, to see the wonder and give thanks to God for this miracle. This was but the beginning of the pilgrimages to the church that began almost immediately, especially from the parishes of Paris. These pilgrimages were encouraged by the authorities of the Church, as well as by the example of the many distinguished visitors and the continued occurrences of many other miracles over the following centuries. These miracles included many cures and healings, as well as the miracles of two children who were brought back to life. Kings and queen were among the many pilgrims who came during the Middle Ages, including King Louis XIII, who came to pray for the capture of Rochelle.</p><p>The Archbishop of Paris confirmed the celebration of the festival on the second Tuesday of May, which is the month of Mary. The small sanctuary was later replaced by a more imposing church whose construction began in the fifteenth century. Particularly remarkable are the stained glass windows that adorn the church and remind the visitor of the extraordinary history of this place. The miraculous wooden statue of Our Lady of Power was desecrated and burned on October 12, 1793, during the ravages of the French Revolution.</p>"

        "eng": "<p>The Order of Canons Regular of Premontre, also known as the Premonstratensians, White Canons, or the Norbertines, are a religious order founded at Premontre in 1120 by Saint Norbert, who later became the Archbishop of Magdeburg.</p><p>Saint Norbert was not a particularly pious young man until he had an encounter with God similar to that of St. Paul. While riding through the countryside one bright day in the year 1115, Norbert had not gone far with the sky darkened due to a sudden storm. A bolt of lightning struck the ground near Norbert, causing his mount to rear and throw him to the ground. Norbert lay unconscious for some time, but when he awoke he went to his knees, calling out: \"Lord, what dost thou wish that I should do?\" A voice was heard to respond: \"Avoid evil and do good.\"</p><p>At that, Norbert was a changed man, determined to obey the heavenly command. He made a spiritual retreat and became a priest, giving away his estates and retiring to a life of rural solitude, applying himself to a life of prayer and contemplation. Saint Norbert left his hermitage from time to time to preach in France, Belgium and Germany, begging for his bread along the way. In time, a few good men were drawn to his sanctity and began to follow him.</p><p>During this time Saint Norbert befriended Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, and it is thought that Saint Bernard's example inspired Saint Norbert to form a similar community for canons. A remote place in the marshy forested lands of Premontre was selected to be the place where they decided to make their place of retreat, devoting themselves to the chanting of the Divine Office, prayer and meditation. Soon they had a simple monastery and church in the wilderness.</p><p>Saint Norbert prayed that he might know the will of God for his order, and he had a vision of Saint Augustine, who gave him his rule and said: \"I am Augustine, Bishop of Hippo; behold here the rule which I have written; if your fellow-brethren, my sons, shall have observed it well, they shall stand without fear in the presence of Christ on the terrible day of the last judgment.\"</p><p>Saint Norbert had a tender devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. She herself, Our Lady of Premontre, appeared to him in a vision, giving Norbert the white habit that he and his brothers in religion were to wear.</p><p>Guerenus wrote in his commentaries on the Canticle of Canticles that: \"Saint Norbert, with his holy Order, was raised up by Divine Providence to render conspicuous in his day two mysteries, the Blessed Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist and the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady.\"</p><p>In only a few years there were nine houses and the order had papal approval from Pope Honorius II. By the middle of the 14th century there were over 1,300 monasteries and 400 convents stretching from Palestine to Norway while nourishing all of Christendom. This was the time of the High Middle Ages, creating the foundation for Western Civilization.</p><p>A little below Lancaster, England, stand the ruins of what was once Cockersands Abbey, also known as Our Lady of the Marshes, and Our Lady of Premontre, because the Premonstratensians were responsible for its erection, changing the bleak and barren lands into fertile profitable ones. When the dissolution of the Lancashire monasteries began in 1537, the Abbey seal was broken and the gold and jewels stolen by King Henry VIII. Furniture and goods were sold, and the monks' quarters stripped of their lead and left to fall into ruin, and decay. Some who live around the ruins claim up-to-date that at midnight the chant of the monks can be heard amid the cries and moans of the desolate.</p><p>Since this monastery had been dedicated to Mary, at least one monk was set aside as the \"Mary priest\" whose special duty it was to offer daily or two or three times a week a votive Mass in honor of Our Lady of Premontre. He also rang the \"Mary Bell\" morning and evening and kept her shrine decked with flowers and lights and saw that the best vessels and finest linens were used on her feast days. Going on a pilgrimage to Mary's shrine, people would be \"measured\" for a candle by taking their length and breadth in the form of a cross and candles were made to equal the sum of these two numbers. The candles were coiled and carried to burn either in supplication or thanksgiving before Our Lady's image. On her feast days large candles, \"wreathed with flowers\" were burned in profusion. They were called \"Gaud-candles\" meaning joy and beauty; now the word degenerated from \"gaud\"  -  gaudy, means crude, loud, ugly.</p><p>Hough de Pourte in 1318 left a yearly rent \"to maintain a 3-pound candle to burn before Our Lady's altar daily at her High Mass,\" whilst John Baret at Bury requested in his will that at his burial and Requiem Mass five men should follow the coffin dressed in black to represent the five wounds of Our Blessed Lord, and five women dressed in white to represent the five joys of Our Blessed Lady. Each \"must hold a candle of clean wax.\" Another man left a half acre of ground to purchase \"Lady\" candles to burn yearly to \"lighten Our Lady's way.\" Countless more of these requests could be enumerated.</p><p>And why this love of candles and light? Because like so much in the Catholic Church is symbolic. A light is put to the wick  -  the hard wax melts and overflows and is drawn downward with blessing from Our Lady; the light illumines our darkness of mind and soul  -  when our hearts are lit with God's love and that of His Blessed Mother, they soften, become filled with God's grace and light, and inevitably shine before men.</p><p>May the candles of Our Lady of Premontre continue to lighten Our Lady in our souls and make us more and more Mary-like each day. May the number of votive Masses in Mary's honor increase and may there be again those who will be proud to style themselves \"Mary priests.\" May hearts glow with love of her. Only through her intercession may we ever hope for the conversion of our land which is so rapidly falling prey to the mighty evils of these modern times in which we all need our Heavenly Mother more than ever before in the world's history.</p>"

This lovely statue, which today stands above the high altar of the Votive Shrine or chapel, was brought from France by a humble and holy Ursuline Sister in fulfillment of a vow.</p><p>Today, Our Lady of Prompt Succor is the only statue in the United States that has been crowned by a Pope's delegate, and it is one of the few miraculous statues in North America. The favors granted by Our Lady of Prompt Succor are so numerous and wonderful, that whole books could be written about them.</p><p>At the outbreak of the French Revolution, and Ursuline nun, Madame St. Michel Gensoul (Frances Agatha Gensoul), was obliged to leave her convent in France, return to the world and wait the time when convents would be reopened. Meanwhile she received a letter from a relative in the Ursulline Convent in New Orleans (Mother St. Andre Madier), saying that sixteen other Ursulines, to excape the government of France, had come to Havana, Cuba, to open a community there. Mother St Michel decided to devote herself to spiritual labors in Louisiana, but her Bishop refused consent, since he hoped the convents of France would soon resume activity, and he told the religious that only the Pope could give her permission, and since he, the Pope was a prisoner of Napoleon, the entire project was out of the question.</p><p>Following an impulse, Mother St. Michel wrote to the Pope and then turning for aid to Our Blessed Mother, she prayed: \"O most Holy Virgin Mary, if you obtain for me a prompt and favorable answer to this letter, I promise to have you honored at New Orleans under the title of Our Lady of Prompt Succor.\"</p><p>The letter was sent from Montpellier to Rome on March 19, 1809, and despite all things to the contrary, Pope Pius replied on April 29, 1809. The request had been obtained thru the prompt aid of Our Lady. In thanksgiving, Mother St. Michel ordered sculptured a beautiful statue of Our Lady holding the Infant Jesus in her arms, Our Lady of Prompt Succor. In this statue, Jesus holds in His Hands a globe, representing the world. Bishop Fournier, recognizing in all this the acts of Divine Providence, asked permission to bless the statue.</p><p>Mother St. Michel and several postulants with the precious statue of Our Lady of Prompt Succor, arrived in New Orleans December 31, 1810. The statue was set up in the chapel of the Sisters on Ursuline St. and Mother St. Michel who taught there, lost no time in spreading devotion to Our Lady, which soon became popular.</p><p>Two signal favors showed Our Lady's pleasure at the devotion: in 1812 a great fire broke out near the convent, which was doomed for destruction. An old lay sister placed a small statue of Our Lady of Prompt Succor on a window ledge facing the approaching flames; at the same time Mother St. Michel fell on her knees and prayed: \"Our Lady of Prompt Succor, we are lost if you do not come to our aid.\" The wind veered, the fire died down and the convent was saved. </p><p>Another great favor was bestowed during the Battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1814. Never before was the city in hopelessly greater danger as the British fleet arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi River. A small American fleet had been left to defend the river, but upon encountering the British Fleet they were quickly \"blown to pieces.\"</p><p>Very Rev. Wm. Doubourg, urged the people to pray to Our Lady. He was not alone. The leader of the meager American forces, General Andrew Jackson, had himself warned the Ursulines and all the citizens of the approaching battle and begged their prayers for victory for his out-numbered army.</p><p>Early Sunday morning while the raging battle could be heard in the city, the convent chapel of Our Lady of Prompt Succor was crowded with petitioners, begging Mary for prompt aid. The statue was placed upon the altar and Mother Superior in the name of the community vowed if the American forces were victorious and God spared the city, the Ursulines would see that each year a Mass of Thanksgiving would be offered in honor of Our Lady of Prompt Succor.</p><p>The British had planned to attack the American defenses, which amounted to nothing more than a barricade of boards set behind a shallow moat, in the darkness just before dawn. They feared the deadly marksmanship of the American riflemen, and did not want to approach them across the field after dawn.</p><p>The British plans were unexpectedly upset, however, and they were unable to get their 20,000 men into position until after sunrise. Even so, it seemed fortune was with them, as a heavy fog worked to conceal their advance over the cane stubble of the field.</p><p>But then something strange and wonderful happened. A wind dispersed the fog just long enough for General Jackson to see the British Redcoats advancing in a straint line, should to shoulder with bayonets drawn. On their chest were white military crossbelts. Jackson gave the command to aim at the crossbelts and his men carried out his order when the enemy had marched within range of their guns.</p><p>There was a deafening explosion from the American guns and at once the front rank of the British column fell and died. The big guns of the British now went into action filling the air with smoke and noise and destruction. Jackson had lined up his men in files. When the first file had fired its guns, it withdrew to the rear to reload while the second file came forward to the wall, took aim and fired. When it had finished its deadly work, the third file advanced. Thus it went in orderly fashion with each of the volleys from the guns taking a terrible toll of the British soldiers.</p><p>The British kept advancing after each deadly volley of gunshots in a straight unbroken line. Instead of breaking ranks, crouching to the ground and firing, they continued marching forward in plain sight of the American militia who were well-protected behind the mud wall and the high boards. The white crossbelts over the scarlet coats made perfect targets for the backwoodsmen from Tennessee and Kentucky, and the British fell lifeless on top of one another under such deadly fire.</p><p>To add to their confusion and rout, those British who had been assigned to bring the scaling ladders to be used in crossing the moat and climbing the walls to the American lines forgot to bring the ladders, and while they rushed to the rear to fetch them, their men were taking a merciless pounding from American guns. British General Gibbs rushed into the lines of his men on horseback encouraging them to attack with bayonets, but the front rank of his soldiers was in retreat and there was so much confusion that he accomplished nothing. </p><p>The battle lasted 25 minutes; the routed British lost 800 dead or missing from action, while Jackson lost only 7 men with an additional 6 wounded. Jackson declared only the aid of the Almighty could have brought about such results. He went himself to the convent afterwards to thank the Ursulines for their prayers and for their nursing of the American wounded.</p><p>Many favors continue to be obtained through Mary's intercession, as records testify.</p><p>Pope Leo XIII, June 21, 1894, issued a decree of privilege to crown the famous statue, which was done Nov. 14, 1894. The two crowns: one for the infant, the other for Mary were made of \"exquisite artistry\"  -  gold, silver, precious stone, donated by hundreds of faithful clients of Our Lady. This was the first of such a ceremony conducted in the United States.</p>"

The statue of Our Lady of Pucha remained there until it was buried beneath a large bell by the religious who lived at that first monastery at Puche when the Moors entered into Spain at the time of the Goths.</p><p>This statue remained in the earth for well over 500 years until Divine providence facilitated the happy discovery by the great servant of God Saint Peter Nolasco, founder and patriarch of the Royal Order of Mercy, the year 1237. Saint Peter Nolasco witnessed on four consecutive Saturdays that seven strange lights looking like seven stars were observed at night over the same place. They would seem to drop from heaven seven times, and disappear into the earth, always in the same place. Saint Peter felt certain that this strange phenomenon had a meaning and purpose; so he commanded men to dig about the spot. They had not gone far into the earth when they came upon a bell of prodigious size, beneath which was a beautiful image of the Virgin Mary. Saint Peter took it up in his arms, recognizing it as a valuable gift from heaven, and built an altar upon the very spot where it was buried. This altar became very celebrated for the number of miracles performed there.</p><p>The discovery of the sacred image of Our Lady of Pucha was a powerful encouragement to King James I of Aragon, who was resolved to finish the conquest of Valencia at that time. He credited Our Lady of Puche, and the prayers of Saint Peter Nolasco, for his conquest when he received into his hands the keys to the city of Valencia from the Moors. He acclaimed Our Lady of Puche the Patroness of Valencia, and of his entire kingdom.</p><p>The holy image was always considered miraculous, and was universally revered throughout Christendom. Popes and kings, and very many people the greatest holiness and nobility came on pilgrimage to Our Lady of Pulce. The powerful protection of Our Lady of Puche was confirmed through many long years, for whenever there was a dangerous storm threatening, the bells in the church bell tower would ring and people would again witness the wonder of the seven stars.</p><p>The angels could also often be heard singing soft melodies and sweetest chants in the choir of the church that were heard by the religious, filling their hearts with heavenly rejoicing.</p><p>It is recorded that a boy named Jose Carbonell, the son of Agustin Carbonell, was pushed by another boy and fell with his arm landing in the path of a heavy cart. The boy's arm was crushed so severely that it was soon considered necessary for a surgeon to cut off the arm to save the child's life.</p><p>The following morning the boy's father went to work at his brother's farm, from which he could see the church of Our Lady of Pulce. He prayed as he worked with humble supplication and many tears. At the end of the day the father returned home to find the surgeon had just arrived and was undoing the bandages over the boy's injured arm. Once it was unwrapped, the surgeon cried out, \"Gentlemen, what is this? This arm is good and healthy!\" In recognition of the favor, the boy eventually took the habit of the Religious of Our Lady of Mercy.</p><p>The heavenly image of Our Lady of Puche was eventually taken from Puche to Valencia at the request of the Catholic monarch Philip II. The people followed the venerable Patriarch Don Juan de Ribera, Archbishop of Valencia, on foot in solemn procession on Sunday, 17 July, 1588. All was done with the same solemnity with which the procession of the Blessed Sacrament occurred in this famous city.</p><p>The praises of the angels could be heard for sixteen nights in the holy church of Valencia, and the wonder of the seven stars was frequently seen, filling with inexpressible joy the witnesses both inside and outside of Valencia. It is known that the stars have appeared many times on the bell tower of the church of Our Lady of Pucha since then, and not only in ancient times, but they were especially noted between the years 1723 to 1758.</p>"

At the coming of Christians, it was turned into a monastery.</p><p>Early in history they acquired the image of Our Lady of Puig, in bas-relief, carved on a slab of marble, which was said to have formed part of the tomb of the Blessed Virgin Mary. How it got to Spain is not known with certainty, though the pious insist that it was brought there by angels. It was the principal object of devotion at the shrine, which thrived and grew beautiful until the ancient kingdom of the Visigoths fell to the Muslim invaders in the 8th Century.</p><p>In the year 712 AD the monks sadly buried their treasure to hide it from desecration, along with the church bell, under the floor of the monastery, and fled for their lives. After five centuries the Moors were expelled from Valencia, and the plaque of Our Lady of Puig played a part in its liberation.</p><p>King Jamie I of Aragon, victorious in other parts of Spain, moved on Valencia with his armies. The Moors, in an effort to trick the Christians into sending their troops to the wrong place, moved to attack the ancient fortress of Puig. This was done with great secrecy, but Our Lady warned the Christians and helped them to win the desperate battle.</p><p>Saint Peter Nolasco, who helped to found the Society for the Redemption of Captives under Our Lady's guidance, was in Puig when the battle took place. One of the soldiers came to him and reported that when he had been on night guard he had seen strange lights over the old ruined church of Our Lady of Puig; sometimes the stars seemed to come down from the sky and circle around the building. Especially on Saturday nights there were bright lights around the mount of the church.</p><p>Saint Peter suggested to the king that all the soldiers should receive the Sacraments and pray to know what God was trying to tell them. After this had been done, he led them to the top of the hill and directed them to dig under the floor of the old monastery. Here they found the plaque and the bell, buried for 500 years, but unharmed.</p><p>The plaque was first carried to the chapel of the castle fortress. As soon as possible a new church was built on the mountain and given into the charge of the Mercedarians under Saint Peter Nolasco.</p><p>The ancient bell which was dated as being cast in 660, was placed in the tower of the church. This bell was said to be powerful against storms and always rung of its own accord in time of trouble. In 1550 the bell broke and a new one was cast from the fragments of the old one.</p><p>The church built by Saint Peter Nolasco was called \"the angelic chamber\" because angels were often heard singing there in the night, especially on Saturdays.</p><p>Our Lady of Puig has been the patroness of Valencia for hundreds of years, and not longer ago than 1935 was honored by the Spanish Armies who have carried her image in so many successful battles.

    "Our Lady of Puy": {
        "eng": "<p>On the road which passes the shrine of Our Lady of the Thorn high up in the Jura Mountains, there is the shrine of Our Lady of Puy. All crusaders passed this on their way to the Holy Land on pilgrimage to rescue the Holy Places from the hands of the infidel.</p><p>There was scarcely a knight who did not go to bid farewell to Our Lady of Puy and ask her to care for his dear ones, should he not return. Close to this shrine lived a wealthy nobleman, lord of a beautiful, spacious castle in the gorge, who offered hospitality to all while they made their devotions to the Mother of God and entrusted themselves body and soul to the Gracious Virgin Mary. Le Puy claims to be the location of the earliest vision of the Blessed Virgin after her death when she appeared to a sick woman in the first century A.D. It happened in this way.</p><p>In about the year 46 Saint Peter sent missionaries into a land that was then known as Gaul (modern day France). Saint George of Velay was the first Bishop of that See. In about the year 70 there was a widow from Ruessium named Villa who was a new convert and became sick with a high fever. Villa prayed to the Blessed Virgin for a cure, and Mary appeared to her, asking Villa to climb Mount Anis to be healed. Villa, believing in the apparition, had her servant carry her to the place indicated. When they reached the spot, the servant set Villa down to rest upon a large rock. Villa fell asleep, and when she awoke she found she was completely cured.</p><p>As the woman had slept, she saw, in a dream, a celestial female, whose dazzling robes floated like a white mist, and whose head was encircled by a crown of precious stones; this woman, of exquisite beauty, was surrounded by a retinue of angelic spirits.</p><p>\"Who,\" inquired the daughter of the Gauls of one of the blessed spirits, \"who is that queen so gracious, so noble, and so beautiful, who comes to me, a poor, sick woman, in my extreme affliction?\"</p><p>\"It is the Mother of God,\" replied the angel; \"she has made choice of this rock to be invoked here, and she charges you to inform her servant George of it. That you may not take the order of Heaven for a vain dream, arise, woman, you are healed.\"</p><p>When she awoke, the woman had, in fact, no more languor or fever. Filled with gratitude, she lost no time in running to the bishop, and relating to him with her own mouth the message of the angel.</p><p>It seems that the Mother of God desired that a church eventually be built there, for when Villa told Bishop George of her miraculous cure, he climbed the mount himself with some of the clergy to see the place. Arriving at the very spot, Saint George was startled to come upon an impossible sight. Even though it was the middle of summer, the peak of Mount Anis was inexplicably covered in snow. Then, as they marveled, a stag came from out of a thicket and stood before them, marking with his careful steps the outline of the rock upon which Villa had recently been cured. Saint George had a fence built around that rock to preserve the place, but it was not until a much later date that the spot became the location of a new church altar.</p><p>It wasn't until the year 221, well over a century later, when the Blessed Virgin, accompanied by angels, appeared to a paralyzed woman who besought her assistance through ardent prayer. Mary told the woman to ascend Mount Anis, which she immediately did. Upon reaching the fence Saint George had erected there, the woman was instantly cured. The Mother of God appeared to the woman now to request that a church be built in her honor upon that holy ground.</p><p>Pope Callistus I gave permission for the church to be constructed, and it was Saint Martial who built the church. He left there a priceless relic  -  one of the sandals of the Blessed Virgin Mary. When the church was completely finished the bishop went to Rome to request a solemn consecration for the church. He had not gotten far when he ran into two dignified old men, each of whom carried a gilded chest. They said the chests held precious relics brought all the way from Rome to be deposited at the new church at Mount Anis, and then told the bishop that heavenly angels had already consecrated the church. Saying so, the pair disappeared.</p><p>The bishop went back to his church barefoot, and upon going inside found it brilliantly illuminated by 300 torches. The altar had only recently been anointed with oil which gave off an appealing aroma. Having been consecrated by angels, the church has never been given any other consecration, and was given the name \"Church of the Angels.\"</p><p>The location became a popular site for pilgrims on the route to Santiago de Compostella in Spain, and there was no place in France more frequented. Some of pilgrims who visited Puy include Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint Dominic, and Saint Vincent Ferrer, among many others. The Emperor Charlemagne visited the church in the years 772 and 800, and selected it as one of the locations for the gathering of alms to support the Pope, which monies became known as \"Peter's Pence.\" The list of holy and great men who came as pilgrims is as impressive as the numbers of ordinary people. Pope Saint Leo IX declared that the Mother of God is nowhere given a more special and filial veneration, and that Notre Dame of Puy was the most illustrious shrine in France.</p><p>The Bishop Adhemar de Montheil, living at Puy, was said to be the first person to take up the Crusader's Cross when Pope Urban II was preaching and encouraging the first Crusade. Acting as the Legate of the Holy See, this bishop went with the famous knight Godfrey de Bouillion on his journey to the Holy Land. Pope Urban II prayed for the success of the crusade at the church of Notre Dame de Puy on the Feast of the Assumption in the year 1095. Shortly before he left, the Bishop Adhemar de Montheil also prayed there for the liberation of the Holy Land, when overcome by a sudden inspiration rose and gave voice to a beautiful new prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary, singing - \"Salve Regina, Mater Misericordiae, vita, dulcedo et spes nostra, salve!\" or \"Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy, hail our life, our sweetness, and our hope!\" This prayer used to be known as the Anthem of Puy, and was a much beloved prayer of the knights on the First Crusade addressed to Our Lady in heaven.</p><p>King Louis IX of France met with the King of Aragon at Puy in the year 1245, and in 1254 Saint Louis gifted the cathedral with an ebony image of Mary. The King had brought the statue back from the Holy Land, where it was known to be a statue of great antiquity. It featured the Blessed Virgin seated upon a throne and holding the Infant Jesus on her lap. In the coming years this statue was carried in procession to implore the intervention of the Blessed Virgin Mary during times of hunger, war or pestilence. The statue survived all throughout the Middle Ages, though the original image was burned by atheistic revolutionaries in 1793 during the French Revolution. The one currently on display is a copy of the original.</p><p>Le Puy observes a privileged jubilee or holy year whenever Good Friday falls on the feast of the Annunciation; this does not happen often  -  the last time was in 1932, and the next time will be after the year 2000.</p><p>In 1860 a large statue of Our Lady of France was blessed at Le Puy; it is made of the metal of over two hundred pieces of artillery, captured by the French at Sevastopol in the Crimean War. It is about 16 meters tall and weighs about 10 tons. Before the rise of Lourdes, Le Puy, Chartres, and Liesse were the greatest Marian centers of France.</p><p>When the consecration of the shrine of Puy was to take place, it was made known to the Bishop that it had been consecrated by angels; the doors opened of themselves; the bells rang of themselves; the candles were found lighted and the Holy Chrism which the angels had used was found still fresh upon the altars and the walls.</p><p>Although Saint George was its first Bishop and had marked out the site of the church, the church was not built until the year 221. Mary herself gave the charge of it to Saint Evodius, Bishop of Vosi, who was ordered by Our Lady to transfer his Episcopal see to Puy.</p>"

At the very least, it has certainly been venerated there for a long time, and is popularly called by the people of Quito Our Lady of the Earthquake. The painting represents the Sorrowful Mother, and in the early years of the twentieth century, devotion to Mary under the title of Our Lady of Quito was introduced into England by the Servite Friars in London. Pope Saint Pius X accorded them an indulgence for those who should pray before her picture, and the devotion was greatly promoted in England by the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, Mother Cornelia Connelly's congregation. The original image at Quito was solemnly crowned in 1918.</p><p>On April 20, 1906, thirty-six boys attending the boarding school of the Jesuit Fathers at Quito, Ecuador, together with Father Andrew Roesch, witnessed the first miracle of this famous picture of Our Lady. While in the refectory they all saw the Blessed Mother slowly open and shut her eyes. The same miracle occurred no less than seven times after that, in favor of the boys at the school, but this time in the chapel to which the picture had been taken.</p><p>Ecclesiastical authorities soon investigated these incidents and finally concluded by ordering the picture to be transferred in procession from the college to the church of the Jesuit Fathers. Once at the church the prodigy was repeated several times before large crowds, and many, many conversions took place because of these miracles. At one time the wonder continued for three consecutive days. At Riobamba, before a faithful reproduction of Our Lady of Quito, the same wonder was seen by more than 20 persons, including the president of the city. In Quito this picture is known as the Dolorosa del Colegie.</p>"

The Spanish, particularly, were subject to raids in which they would be captured and imprisoned, sold into slavery and often forced to renounce their Catholic faith or face discrimination, torture and death.</p><p>Long before the First Crusade, organizations like the knights of St. John Hospitaller and the Templars were formed to protect Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land, while the Hospitallers also ran hospices along the route to the Holy Land and even a hospital in Jerusalem. There were also charitable institutions, usually run by the nobility, that would ransom Christian captives from imprisonment.</p><p>In the year 1203, a man named Peter Nolasco formed an organization that would ransom those who were not wealthy or prominent men, whom he called the \"poor of Christ.\" Saint Peter Nolasco was not a priest, but he worked diligently to rescue Christian captives, and other men soon joined him in this charitable work. Unfortunately, there were far more captives than he was able to help, so Peter turned to God and His Blessed Mother in prayer for help. It was then that the Blessed Mother, Our Lady of Ransom, appeared to him on August 1, 1218, turning his order into a religious organization with the assistance of Saint Raimund, and the protection of King James I of Aragon.</p><p>Saint Peter Nolasco went to the court of King James I the following day, and as the king had also received a vision of the Blessed Virgin, he was extremely supportive of what Peter Nolasco intended to do. In fact, King James considered himself a founder of the order, and gave his own illustrious coat of arms, with a cross above a shield with four red stripes on a gold background, to be worn on their breasts and scapulars. The cross is the Maltese Cross of the Knights of Saint John, the military order who had fought so magnificently against Islam for centuries.</p><p>On August 10th, the Celestial and Military Order of Our Lady of Mercy and the Redemption of the Captives was officially constituted at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Barcelona. One of the vows of its members is that they will take the place of captives, and even die for any Christian who was in danger of losing his Catholic faith.</p><p>In 1235 Pope Gregory IX formally recognized the Order inspired by Our Lady of Ransom, which at one point was renowned for having rescued 70,000 Christian souls. It is estimated that 2,700 were rescued during the lifetime of Saint Peter Nolasco, who died in the year 1258.</p>"

He was a typical intellectual of the nineteenth century, a worshipper of humanity, who sneered at anything spiritual in his pride and ignorance.</p><p>In November 1841, Alphonse found himself in Rome, although his itinerary had not called fro a stop in the Eternal City.

The Baron urgently requested him to wear the Miraculous Medal and to recite daily the prayer of Saint Bernard, \"The Memorare.\" Alphonse did so in the spirit of acceptance and of dare but without the slightest bit of faith.</p><p>On January 20, 1842, Monsieur de Bussiere saw Alphonse walking along the street and invited him into his carriage. They stopped at Saint Andrea delle Fratee because the Baron wished to see a priest there.

The blessed Virgin spoke not a word, but these things came to him as he knelt before her.</p><p>The next day Alphonse was baptized by Cardinal Patrizi, vicar of Pope Gregory XVI.

The people rushed to the spot, and so the plot was discovered, and the entire town saved through the intervention of Our Lady of Rennes. Great was the rejoicing and deep the gratitude of the people.</p><p>Known today as the Basilica of Saint Sauveur in Rennes, it is located in the heart of historic Rennes, which was once the capital of Brittany. It is situated at the termination of Saint-Sauveur Street on which its fa\u00e7ade faces.</p><p>As the original Gothic church partially collapsed in the year 1682, the Classical style church that can currently be seen was constructed beginning in 1703 and consecrated in August of 1719.</p><p>In the year 1793, during the French Revolution, the church was made into a Temple of Reason, and the miraculous statue of Our Lady was destroyed. It was not until 1802, after the end of the Terror, that the church was opened again to worship. The church was made into a minor basilica in 1916 by Pope Benedict XV. </p><p>According to popular tradition there was a famous miracle attributed to Our Lady at Rennes during the War of Succession at Brittany. As Rennes was being besieged by the invading English army under the Duke of Lancaster, the people of the city expected the English forces to mine their way under the walls into the city.</p><p>On the night of February 8, 1357, the church bells began to ring of their own accord, and the candles were spontaneously lit. The statue of Our Lady, known as Our Lady of Miracles and Virtues, pointed out a particular slab in the church. The inhabitants of the city thus were alerted to the mine and the point of the English attack, and were able to repulse the invasion. The miracle was a popular subject for ballads, especially the troubadour Cuvelier. In 1634 the miracle was officially recognized by the Bishop of Rennes, Pierre Cornulier.</p><p>There are many miracles attributed to Our Lady, including the miraculous healing of Magdalene Morice in the year 1761. She had gangrene in her right foot which was instantly healed on Easter Sunday.</p><p>The statue of Our Lady of Miracles and Virtues currently displayed at the basilica was placed there in February of 1876.</p><p>In 1684 a boy of eleven left home for the city of Rennes in hopes of enrolling at the Jesuit College of Thomas a Becket.

When the Vandals finally arrived at the city gates, Saint Nicasius went out to meet them with his sister, a faithful lector and a deacon. All were killed, but their sacrifice gave time for more of the people of Rheims to flee to safety.</p><p>It is interesting to note that when Saint Nicasius was beheaded he was praying Psalm 119. He was slain at the moment when he reached the phrase \"Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,\" which means, \"my soul is attached to dust.\" After he was decapitated, his head struck the ground and he miraculously continued the psalm, saying: \"Vivifica me, Domine, secundum verbum tuum,\" which means, \"revive me, Lord, with your words.\"</p><p>This was the church where King Clovis humbly confessed his belief in the Triune God and was baptized by Saint Regigius in 496, and where all of the subsequent French kings were crowned.

        "eng": "<p>The pilgrimage of Our Lady of Rocamadour, a short distance from Cahors, is situated in the most sterile and mountainous part of Quercy. A saint, whom an unsupported local tradition would make the Zaccheus of the Gospel, about the third century, penetrated into a labyrinth of rocks which raise their lofty crests above the narrow and deep ravine where the Lauzou rolls its waters; this ravine, which is at this day named the valley of the Rocamadour , was then called the Dark Valley, and abounded in wild beasts.</p><p>This scenery, melancholy, but not without grandeur, which reminded one of Thebais, had doubtless some analogy with the deep and austere thoughts of the anchorite; he made himself a cell on one of the prominent peaks of the mountain, and hallowed out of the rock, on a level with the eagles' nests, an oratory to the Mother of God, Our Lady of Rocamadour. The Gallico-Roman population of the fine valleys of Figeac and Saint-Cere, who sometimes perceived him from a distance on the sharp point of these bare and wild mountains, the height of which turns one giddy, surnamed him Amator Rupis; this name, the only one which has come down to us, was changed into that of Amador, then Amadour, as more congenial to the dialect of the South.</p><p>The little statue of the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Rocamadour, resembling those which the new Christians of Gaul venerated in the hollows of oak trees, was the instrument of miracles in favor of the fervent pilgrims who came to invoke her in her rocky sanctuary. The pilgrims multiplied, and soon became so frequent, that a town was built at the foot of the holy place. This town, situated in a desolate region, on a spot unproductive, and one of the most difficult of access at first, became nevertheless, thanks to the devotion of our fathers, one of the principal towns of Quercy; it had towers, consuls, and a coat-of-arms in which three rocks argent figured with lilies or, upon a field gules.</p><p>Above the steeple of the old church of Rocamadour, at a prodigious height, arose a citadel destined to protect the rich sanctuary of Mary; those bastions, the outlines of which were proudly traced against the clouds, and which now cover the soil of their ruins, could not repulse the gloomy followers of Calvin, who would have gone through hell itself for the sake of gold. The chapel of Our Lady of Rocamadour has now-a-days a better bulwark  -  its poverty.</p><p>This pilgrimage to Our Lady of Rocamadour was celebrated even in the time of Charlemagne; the famous knight-errant Roland, nephew of this emperor, came to Rocamadour in 778. He offered to the Blessed Virgin a gift of silver of the weight of his sword, and after his death in the fields of Roncevaux, this sword was brought to Rocamadour. (It is said the sword, Durandal, can still be seen there.)</p><p>In the year 1170, according to Roger de Hoveden, Henry II., King of England and Duke of Guienne, through his wife Eleanor, came to Our Lady of Rocamadour to fulfill a vow, which he had made to the Blessed Virgin in a long illness, with which he was attacked at La Motte-Gercei. As the lands bordering upon Quercy had no great liking for the Englishman, the island monarch protected himself with a small army to make this pious voyage. Henry left marks of his munificence at the chapel of Our Lady, and with the poor of Rocamadour.</p><p>In the number of illustrious pilgrims, who came to honor Mary in her mountain sanctuary, is reckoned Simon de Montfort, legate of the pope; Arnauld Amalric, who was afterwards Bishop of Narbonne; Saint Louis, accompanied by his three brothers, by Queen Blanche of Castile, and Alphonsus, Count of Boulogne, who ascended the throne of Portugal; King Charles the Fair, King John, Louis XIl, and a multitude of powerful lords.</p><p>Among the great bishops who visited, at different times, the miraculous chapel of Our Lady, we find one name so dear to literature, to humanity, and to Catholicism, that we cannot leave him among the crowd. This name, by which France considers herself honored, and which commands the respect even of impiety itself, is that of the swan of Cambray. Devoted from his cradle to Our Lady of Rocamadour, by his pious mother, Fenelon came more than once to pray, in the depths of Quercy, to her who had laid on his lips a comb of Attic honey, and given him the courageous wisdom which he employed so nobly in the instruction of kings. Two pictures, hung up as votive offerings, in the sanctuary of Mary, represent two solemn phases of his existence. In the first, he is newly-born, and sleeps in his cradle; in the second, being a young man, and already a doctor, he comes to pay homage to this divine Protectress, for the first success of his rising genius. At some distance is a tomb, over which he wept and prayed later on  -  that of his mother, whose wish was to sleep her last sleep in the shadow of the altar of Mary, Our Lady of Rocamadour.</p><p>Sometimes it was not merely isolated pilgrims, but cities and provinces in a body, who repaired to Rocamadour. \"In 1546,\" says M. de Malleville, in is Chronicles of Quercy, \"on the 24th of June, the day and feast of the blessed Sacrament and of Saint John, was the great pardon of Rocamadour. The concourse of people of the kingdom, and of foreigners, was so great, that several persons, of all ages and of each sex, were smothered up in the crowd, and a very great number of tents were set up in the country, on all sides, like a great encampment.</p><p>The gifts received by the sanctuary of Rocamadour were of great magnificence. Among them appears the forest of Mont-Salvy, given in 1119 by Odo, Count of La Marche, \"to the Blessed Mary of Roc-Amandour.\" The lands of Gornellas and Orbanella, \"for the good of the souls of his relatives,\" by Alphonso IX, King of Leon, in 1181.</p><p>In the year 1202, Sancho VII, King of Navarre, gave a revenue of forty-eight pieces of gold for lighting the chapel of Notre Dame. In 1208, Savaric, Prince of Mauleon, a great captain and famous troubadour, gave as a pure and perpetual alms, to the Blessed Mary of Rocamadour, his land of Lisleau, with absolute exemption from all tax and charge. Pope Clement V., in 1314, left a legacy to the same church, \"to keep up perpetually a lighted wax candle honorably in a vase or dish or silver, in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Rocamadour, to honor this Blessed Virgin, and obtain the deliverance of his soul.\"</p><p>It would be too long to cite the other benefactors of the chapel of Mary; the whole extent of this blessed rock shone with votive offerings of gold, pearls, and precious stones. Spanish princesses had worked its rich hangings with their own hands, and fourteen lamps of massive silver, the twisted chains of which formed a magnificent network, lighted up Our Lady of Rocamadour night and day.</p><p>By a contrast not found anywhere but in Christendom, the altar of the Madonna was of wood, as it was in the time of Saint Amadour, and the miraculous image was a little statue of dark oak, very rudely carved. A remarkable object in the roof of the chapel, in a belfry, surrounded by brilliant windows of painted glass, was a small bell without any rope, which sounded by itself whenever it pleased the Star of the Sea to manifest her power in favor of vessels in distress which called upon her amidst the solitudes of the ocean.</p><p>The Virgin of Quercy was a prey too precious to escape from Protestantism. On the 3rd of September, 1592, Duras took possession of Rocamadour. The crosses were broken, the images disfigured, the rich vestments burned and torn up into shreds, the bells melted down, and the body of Saint Amadour, smashed with the stroked of the hammer, was profanely cast into the flames. The atheists of 1793 put the seal to these devastations.</p><p>At the present time, the towers of the city are buried beneath the turf; shrubs are growing on the ruins of the citadel; tufts of grass spring up between the disjointed stones of the magnificent flight of two hundred and seventy-eight steps, which leads from the city to the airy sanctuary of Mary. The guitar of the cantadours of Languedoc no longer celebrates the miracles of Our Lady of Rocamadour, and the night wind alone whistles in that antique chapel, where the organ has been removed for the sake of economy. The Blessed Virgin of Rocamadour might now call herself the Virgin of Ruins, and yet she still works miracles.</p>"

The incident that he states had occurred in the year 434 actually occurred in 1434, but that is getting ahead of our story.</p><p>Simon was born on September 4, 1401, in the city of Paris, France, to pious and wealthy parents. Growing up a good Catholic, Simon despised money and luxury, so that when he grew up and inherited his parents' money and property, he recognized it for the threat to his eternal welfare that it was, and gave all that he owned to the church and to relieve the poor. Once the money was gone, he went to a Franciscan monastery and took a position as a chamber boy.</p><p>Simon naturally spent a great deal of time in prayer, and was especially devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Sometimes when he prayed he asked the Mother of God if there was anything he might do that would be especially pleasing to her. On one of these occasions he fell asleep while praying. He was suddenly awakened when he heard a voice speak to him from the empty church:</p><p>\"Simon, wake up; be on the watch\u2026From now on your name will be Simon Vela. Go to Pena de Francia, for there you will find the shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\"</p><p>Simon traveled for five years over fields and mountains, searching through lonely valleys and gloomy caves in his quest for this place called Pena de Francia, but he could not even find anyone who had ever heard of the place. On the verge of giving up in frustration, he had already begun working his way back home from Spain when the voice spoke to him from the darkness once again:</p><p>\"Simon, do not give up the search; do not give up what you have begun. Persevere and your labors will be recompensed.\"</p><p>Feeling that it was still the will of God, Simon was determined to continue the search.</p><p>Simon was passing through the market square in Salamanca on his way to the Church of Santiago when he observed two men who began shouting in a serious disagreement. Weapons flashed, and one of the pair fell wounded at Simon's feet. The other was restrained from finishing the man by the crowd, who held him back. Unable to reach his adversary, he shouted:</p><p>\"Had I killed my enemy, I would have escaped to Pena de Francia where no one, not even the king, could find me!\"</p><p>Simon's heart leapt for joy when he heard this, for it was the first time he had heard the place spoken of, and now he was certain that his search would not be in vain.</p><p>It was a short time later when Simon received a second bit of good news. He was on his way to the church of Saint Martin when he happened upon a travelling merchant. Simon asked the man where he had come from, and he answered Pena de Francia. Thrilled to hear the name, he felt his search was nearly over, but when he asked the man to take him there, he refused. He did not want to go back the way he had come, no matter how much Simon begged him. All he would do was point out the general direction.</p><p>Simon went down the road from which he had seen the merchant approach, hoping he was not too far from his destination. The road led him to a villa named San Martin de Castanar, which he reached on May 14, 1434. He found a church there, and after Mass he asked if anyone knew of a place called Pena de Francis. One man knew of it, and when Simon kindly asked him to show him where it was, the man walked with him a good distance from the church and then pointed out a hill in the far distance. That, he said, was Pena de Francia. Simon was elated, thanking God and the man for revealing to him the place that meant the end of his quest.</p><p>The place was far off, but Simon went off at once, thinking the years he had spent in seeking were nearly at an end. He gave no thought to his provisions, and as the journey was long and arduous, he was far from any help when he realized how weakened his fast had made him. Suffering intense pangs of hunger, Simon did not despair, for he felt certain that God would not forsake him. He continued on his way, and soon came across an abandoned pack that contained a loaf of bread and a piece of meat. Refreshed, he turned his attention to finding shelter as the night approached. Finding a suitable cave, he went inside and prayed for guidance until he dropped off into welcome slumber.</p><p>Waking early in the morning, Simon began to search the area for the shrine, and quickly found that there were caves all over the hill where he had slept. He naturally became discouraged when it became apparent that it could take him weeks or even months to find what he sought, and so, feeling that it was almost as if his quest had started all over again, he fell to his knees and prayed for the grace of perseverance. His prayer was quickly answered, as the now familiar voice said:</p><p>\"Simon, be awake: do not sleep.\"</p><p>Simon got up at once and continued his search, awakening with renewed enthusiasm the following morning. As he prepared to leave his cave a brilliant light struck his eyes, the source of which was a spot some distance away on a rocky hill. Trembling with joy, Simon approached the source of that light and found the Blessed Virgin Mary sitting on a golden throne with the Child Jesus in her arms. His heart overflowing with inexpressible joy, he knelt and said:</p><p>\"Oh, Lady, dream of my soul, and inspiration of men and women! My labors are now ended. Many years have I traveled far and wide to seek you and to drink in the beauty of your eyes! Do not forsake me, but be my protection.\"</p><p>Our Lady answered sympathetically:</p><p>\"Simon, rejoice! Your constancy will be rewarded. Your dream will be realized. Your labors are now ended. Take heed and keep in your heart what I wish you to do. Dig in this spot and take what you can see and place it on the summit of this rocky hill. Build on this hill a beautiful shrine. You are to begin it and others will come to finish it. This must come to pass as it has been the wish of my child.\"</p><p>When the vision ended, Simon remained alone for some time, filled with wonder and awe.</p><p>On the spot where the apparition of the Holy Virgin had appeared, Simon began the work of excavating. He had barely begun digging when he heard the same voice once again saying:</p><p>\"Simon, do not attempt to undertake this large of a task alone. Undertake it in the presence and with the help of two, three, or more persons.\"</p><p>Evidently this demand was made to ward off any suspicion about the veracity of the coming miracle as well as Simon's credibility. So Simon went back to San Martin de Castanar and asked five men to help him, and all of them agreed.</p><p>Even though Simon told them the truth, these men believed that they were digging for hidden treasure. Simon repeated that they were after an objective worthier than merely worldly goods, and that it was something their hearts would forever cherish. They dug for some time, until finally, on May 19, 1434, they removing a huge stone that was barring their way. They found beneath it, sheltered among several smaller rocks, the most coveted image of the Blessed Virgin Mary with the Divine Child in her arms, now known as Our Lady of Rocks.</p>"

Seeking to surprise the slumbering inhabitants of the town, they snuck up to the walls and silently placed their ladders against them and began to climb. When the first of them reached the top, they were met and repulsed by Our Lady, who appeared attired in purple, while holding in her hand a lighted torch. The sight of the glory of the heavenly Queen so terrified the invaders that they advanced no further and took to flight. Thus, the Muslims were driven from the walls by Our Lady of Rossano, who appeared to save the people of this town located in southern Italy in the province of Calabria. </p><p>Rossano, or Roscianum as it was known in Roman times when it was an outpost of the budding empire, was thought to have actually been founded well over a millennium before the time of Christ. The town experienced attacks from the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Lombards when the Roman Empire fell in the west, although it was never subjugated by any enemy. The town reached its peak of wealth and influence during the 6th through the 11th century when it was ruled by Byzantium. Located near the Gulf of Taranto, and being close to the water, Rossano was subject to Muslim raids over the following centuries.</p><p>The island of Sicily was conquered by Islamic forces in the 10th century, and was used by them as a base of operations for raids into Italy and other vulnerable cities in the region. Although they gained small footholds here and there on the Italian peninsula, the Muslims were not able to hold their possessions for long. Toward the end of the 10th century the Emir Abu al-Qasim commenced a string of assaults into Calabria. At the same time a Muslim fleet under the command of the Emir's brother made raids along the coasts of Apulia, overwhelming unwary strongholds, looting towns and taking slaves.</p><p>Although Our Lady of Rossano commemorates the Marian apparition that saved Rossano, the town is probably most famous for an ancient image of the Blessed Virgin that can be seen in the Cathedral of Our Lady Achiropita. It is known as the Madonna acheropita, or \"The Madonna not made by hands.\" Like the Virgin de la Antigua of Seville, which was miraculously revealed to Saint Fernando III, the image of the Blessed Virgin holding the Christ Child was revealed beneath a layer of plaster in the cathedral of Rossano, and has been dated to sometime between the years 580 and 750 AD.</p>"

It is estimated that between 30 and 60% of Europe's population died from the plague between the years 1347 and 1350.</p><p>For their deliverance from the plague the people built a beautiful edifice known as Our Lady of the Vow in the chapel of the cathedral to commemorate the event. Throughout Rouen, squares, fountains, and public monuments all bore Mary's image as a token of gratitude. The magistrates suspended a massive golden lamp over the white marble Madonna on the altar which burned without interruption until it was extinguished by the Protestants in the sixteenth century.</p><p>The kings of France have granted the Cathedral of Rouen great privileges throughout the centuries.</p><p>In the 16th century the cathedral suffered heavy destruction at the hands of pious Calvanists, who destroyed statues, tombs, furnishings, and even the priceless stained glass windows. Later, in the 20th century, the church was intentionally bombed in April of 1944, which did extensive damage but did not level the church, and was bombed again in June of the same year, which resulted in the loss of the North Tower.</p><p>In our own day, the cathedral of Our Lady of Rouen is perhaps most famous for the 28 paintings that the impressionist Claude Monet painted of it.</p>"

Many of these young men found a place of hiding in Overloon.</p><p>There are stories that several times this little town of some 1700 or 1800 inhabitants, had as many as 200 fugitives, hiding in the homes of the town.</p><p>A great many of these refugees who found a hiding place in Overloon, promised the Blessed Virgin they would erect a shrine in her honor if she would help save them.</p><p>The battle to free Overloon took place between 30 September and 18 October 1944, and was fought between the Allied forces and the German army. After suffering heavy losses, the battle resulted in an allied victory freeing the town of Overloon from German occupation. The battle had been ferocious, as 2,500 soldiers died at Overloon while the village itself was completely destroyed. For some reason this battle is not much remembered in the Netherlands, even though there is a museum in Overloon where the broken armored vehicles and tanks that had been left behind on the battlefield have been preserved for viewing.</p><p>After the war was over and peace came to the country, the Dutchmen who had been hiding in Overloon got together and built the promised shrine at Overloon, dedicating it to the Mother of God under the title of Our Lady of Safety or Safe Hiding. The following is from a translation of the Reuters article of December 4, 1954:</p><p>\"On Wednesday, December 8, on the feast of Our Lady's Immaculate Conception, a chapel in Overloon will be consecrated. This simple chapel stands on the road that leads to Limburg, and will be dedicated to Our Lady of Safe Hiding. It was in mid 1942 that the first of those seeking safety from the brutal German occupiers sought hospitality in Overloon. By mid-1944 there were about 200 young men hiding in Overloon waiting for the day of liberation. In one of the forested areas there was even a student camp furnished with tents. This was all possible thanks to the wise and careful planning of an organization then at work, and to the hospitality and silence of the people of Overloon.</p><p>In 1945, those who had once been in hiding in Overloon, and who had enjoyed the generosity of the village, gathered funds for a memorial to the memory of those anxious days, and in gratitude to the people whose silence and hospitality had kept them alive. And so now this memorial is erected: a chapel dedicated to Mary, Our Lady of Safety, the patroness of Safe Hiding. The designer of this chapel is the architect Strik, while the famous Brabant sculptor Piet van Dongen created a fine image depicting the Madonna with two young men hiding under her cloak.\"</p>"

The statue is small, being about 50 cm tall, and is made of poor materials, with a wood frame and a combination of cornstalks and glue that commonly crumbles into dust after a short time. Still, it is an object of popular veneration for good reason, and for hundreds of years it has been one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in Mexico.</p><p>The face of the image is smooth and finely sculpted. The dark brown hair is pulled back from the face. The eyes are large and dark brown, both beautiful and strikingly sculpted for such a small statue. The hands are joined in prayer, with the delicate fingers somewhat separated. Created to be a reflection of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, she wears a white gown under a blue mantle.</p><p>The first time we hear of the statue is in 1542 when the Spanish priest, Father Miguel de Bologna, brought it with him to the town of San Juan Bautista Mezquititlan, which was then inhabited by Nochiztlecan Indians. The statue was originally kept in a small thatch roofed chapel, although by 1623 we find it and the chapel were personally cared for by Pedro Antes and his wife Ana Lucia, both of whom were elderly Indians.</p><p>Ana Lucia, who had a great devotion to the Blessed Virgin, loved and venerated the image, claiming to have conversations with the Mother of God through the statue. Nothing much came of these revelations, though, for no one believed Ana, thinking her experiences only the ramblings of a senile old woman. In fact, by this time the statue was no longer kept in its place of honor above the altar, and had been relegated to a corner of the sacristy where it was nearly forgotten by anyone but Ana Lucia.</p><p>This was all to change. Later that same year a man brought his family to entertain the town. They were a family of aerial acrobats, and during their act he, his wife, and their two daughters seemed to fly through the air by the clever employment of ropes, somewhat in the manner of trapeze artists. The act was already dangerous, but to heighten the suspense the entertainers had swords and daggers placed on the ground below the aerialists  -  with the blades pointing upward.</p><p>The youngest child, a girl of only six or seven years of age, fell from a rope while practicing for the upcoming performance and was impaled upon one of the blades. The parents were helpless to save their dying child, for the wound was mortal. Grieving over their loss, the sorrowful parents carried their daughter to the nearby chapel of Our Lady of Saint John to be buried.</p><p>Ana Lucia, as caretaker of the chapel, was one of the first to learn about the tragedy. She immediately rushed to the sacristy to obtain her beloved statue of the Blessed Virgin, and soon returned with it in her arms. Encouraging the grief-stricken parents to have faith in God, Ana Lucia explained that this was surely the design of God, and then placed the little statue of the holy Virgin upon the body of their lifeless daughter as Ana began to pray.</p><p>Even though many thought the old woman eccentric, to say the least, none dared to interfere at that moment. Suddenly there was a movement from beneath the burial shroud. All stared mutely at the unmistakable shifting of the little body. Her small voice could be heard to calling for her mother.</p><p>Hardly able to believe their eyes, the parents called their daughter's name as they quickly loosed the child. With her eyes wide open, the little girl sat up and hugged her mother. Not only was she alive, but she was also completely healed.</p><p>News of what had happened spread far and wide, and was enough to ignite devotion to Our Blessed Mother through the image of Our Lady of Saint John of the Lakes. Many other miracles followed, and countless prayers were answered through this miraculous image.</p><p>The thankful father, feeling indebted to the Blessed Virgin, asked permission to take the statue to Guadalajara where he might find an artist who could restore and dress the statue. The pastor granted the request, and sent a few Indians along to escort the statue. No sooner did they arrive in Guadalajara than they were approached by an unknown man who inquired if they were looking for a capable artist to repair a sacred statue. There was no way he could have known of their mission, so when he offered them his services they believed it was the will of God that his offer should be accepted. A price was soon agreed upon, and the stranger left with the statue. A short time afterward, he returned with the job completed. The statue was cleaned, and the face and hands skillfully restored. After that the stranger left, leaving his identity a mystery.</p><p>The crowds that came to venerate Our Lady in this image became so large that in 1732 construction began on a new church.Our Lady of Saint John of the Lakes was installed on a special platform displaying an upturned crescent moon, which is reminiscent of her image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.In 1904 the Archbishop of Guadalajara, with the permission of His Holiness Pope Saint Pius X, crowned the statue of Our Lady.</p>"

They heard a sound and looking around, they saw sitting on a nearby stone a lovely lady with a child in her arms. Before they recovered from their surprise the lady spoke to them. She told them not to be afraid and not to worry, that she was the one to whom they had been praying so fervently, and that she wished to have a church built on that spot in her honor. She asked them to go and bring their father, as she wished to speak to him.</p><p>The girls told the lady that their father could not come because he was so sick; he could not even get up out of his bed. But she assured them that he was now well again and that they should go and get him. Obeying, the girls hurried to their home and found their father completely recovered. They returned with him to the shrine; the Lady was still sitting on the stone. She told the father of her wish that a church be built on that spot. The man and his daughters spread the story of his recovery and of how the Virgin had appeared, but very few believed them and nothing at all was done about the church.</p><p>Then on August 15, the feast of the Assumption, when a goodly number where gathered at the shrine, the Virgin appeared for the third time. She told them she was displeased at the delay and demanded that they get busy and build her a church.</p><p>This time they believed her and started to work. However, since the ground around the stone on which she had appeared seemed too steep to attempt to put a building there, they started to lay the foundation at a place some few hundred feet away. But when the masons arrived for the work the following morning, they found the walls they had laid the day before were demolished and the stones strewn around. After this happened several times, they decided that the Virgin did not want the church built there, but over on the spot where the stone was. So they bowed to the inevitable and with great labor, leveled off the ground around the stone, and there erected the church in honor of Our Lady of Sasopoli.</p><p>Since the Virgin had appeared on the stone, and moreover, insisted that the church be erected on that very spot, it was natural the church and the image be called Madonna del Sasso or Our Lady of Sasopoli, Our Lady of the Stone.</p>"

While his companions gave gifts and talked of the slipper of Our Lady, he gave nothing and scoffed at the idea, muttering, \"You are very foolish to believe this to be the Virgin's slipper. It would have rotted long ago.\" At these words Boso's blasphemous mouth was drawn toward his ear with such sharp pain that his eyes seemed to slip out of his head. A tumor appeared and covered his face, making it unfit for human use. Roaring and writhing, he threw himself before the altar of Mary, begging for help, as he had offended the Mother of God, and he knew there was no one else who could heal him.</p><p>The abbess, a woman named Mathilda, took the slipper and made the sign of the cross over the victim. Immediately he began to heal. The punished scoffer repented and gave himself up to the service of the Church of Soissons. Many  -  the lame, the blind, the deaf, the dumb, the paralytics, were healed at the shrine.</p><p>The Abbey was once the largest in France, famous for its rich collection of relics, including the \"Lady Slipper,\" but all that remains today of the abbey is a ruined wall with two arches, as the rest was methodically razed by the eager hands of the devotees of the French Revolution.</p>"

    "Our Lady of Sorrows": {
        "eng": "<p>Devotion to the Sorrows of Mary has always been a favorite devotion among Catholics. It has been sanctioned by the Church and introduced into the Missal and Breviary. In order to keep before our minds the inexpressible sufferings endured for us by the Mother of God while she lived here on earth with her Divine Son, the Church observes two feasts in honor of the Seven Dolors of Mary; one on the Friday before Good Friday and the other on September 15. She has enriched with numerous indulgences the Rosary of the Seven Dolors, as well as a number of other devotions to the Mother of Sorrows. How touching is the beautiful hymn, Stabat Mater Dolorosa, which the Church intertwines with the public recitation of the Way of the Cross. The Church spares no pain to induce her children to venerate the sufferings of their Heavenly Mother. Seven of her sorrows have been chosen for our special veneration. Holy Church recalls to our mind only seven of Our Lady's Dolors, but who could form an estimate of their real number! The sufferings of the Mother of God cannot be comprehended; they are inconceivable. But although her whole life was, like that of her Divine Son, a continuous series of sufferings and tribulations, the greatest woes and trials came to her during the week of the bitter passion and death of Jesus, when the storm of hatred and fury burst forth with all violence against Him. The precise object of the devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows consists of a heartfelt and sincere compassion for the Sorrows which the most holy Virgin endured through her whole life, especially for her long martyrdom, which began with the prophecy of holy Simeon and was consummated on Calvary.</p><p>Devotion to the sorrows of Mary should be practiced especially by souls who wish to rid themselves of sinful habits. This devotion nourishes the spirit of compunction, affords great consolation, strengthens confidence in God's mercy, draws down the special protection of the Blessed Mother in the hour of temptation and preserves the converted sinner from relapsing into sin. The Mother of God once said to her faithful servant St. Bridget: \"No matter how numerous a person's sins may be, if he turns to me with a sincere purpose of amendment, I am prepared forthwith to receive him graciously, for I do not regard the number of sins he has committed, but look only upon the dispositions with which he comes to me; for I feel no aversion in healing his wounds, because I am called and am in truth the Mother of Mercy.\" One of the gifts granted to those who have a devotion to the Dolors of Mary is the grace of a good and holy death. In recompense for her fidelity in remaining near to Jesus as He died on the Cross, Our Lady of Sorrows has received from Him a special power to assist souls in their last agony and no doubt she will above all exercise this power in behalf of those who have wept with her and compassionated her.</p><p>Our Lord once said to Veronica of Binasco: \"My daughter, the tears which you shed in compassion for My sufferings are pleasing to Me, but bear in mind that on account of My infinite love for My Mother, the tears you shed in compassion for her sufferings are still more precious.\"</p><p><strong><em>Seven Sorrows of Mother Mary</em></strong></p></p><p>1. The prophecy of Simeon: \"And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted; And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that out of many hearts thoughts may be revealed.\"  -  Luke II, 34-35.<br/>2. The flight into Egypt: \"And after they (the wise men) were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: Arise and take the child and His mother and fly into Egypt: and be there until I shall tell thee. For it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy Him. Who arose and took the child and His mother by night, and retired into Egypt: and He was there until the death of Herod.\"  -  Matt. II, 13-14.<br/>3. The loss of the Child Jesus in the temple: \"And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the Child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and His parents knew it not. And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And not finding Him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking Him.\" Luke II, 43-45.<br/>4. The meeting of Jesus and Mary on the Way of the Cross: \"And there followed Him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented Him.\"  -  Luke XXIII, 27.<br/>5. The Crucifixion: \"They crucified Him. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, His Mother. When Jesus therefore had seen His Mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, He saith to His Mother: Woman: behold thy son. After that he saith to the disciple: Behold thy Mother.\"  -  John XIX, l8-25-27.<br/>6. The taking down of the Body of Jesus from the Cross: \"Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counselor, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking Him down, wrapped Him up in the fine linen.\"  -  Mark XV, 43-46.<br/>7. The burial of Jesus: \"Now there was in the place where He was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein no man yet had been laid. There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulcher was nigh at hand.\" John XIX, 41-42.<br/></p><p><em>The Blessed Virgin Mary grants seven graces to the souls who honor her daily bysaying seven Hail Mary's and meditating on her tears and dolors (sorrows).The devotion was passed on by St. Bridget.</em></p><p><strong><em>Seven graces are:</em></strong></p></p><p>1. I will grant peace to their families.<br/>2. They will be enlightened about the divine mysteries.<br/>3. I will console them in their pains and I will accompany them in their work.<br/>4. I will give them as much as they ask for as long as it does not oppose the adorable will of my divine Son or the sanctification of their souls.<br/>5. I will defend them in their spiritual battles with the infernal enemy and I will protect them at every instant of their lives.<br/>6. I will visibly help them at the moment of their death, they will see the face of their Mother.<br/>7. I have obtained from my divine Son, that those who propagate this devotion to my tears and dolors, will be taken directly from this earthly life to eternal happiness since all their sins will be forgiven and my Son and I will be their eternal consolation and joy.</p>",

Her aid was invoked on behalf of a dumb man who went on pilgrimage there, and the Blessed Virgin miraculously restored his speech. From that time on she was given the title Our Lady of Speech. Here again the words of the \"Memorare\" were verified:\"Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,that never was it known that anyone who fled to your protection,implored your help or sought your intercession,was left unaided.</p><p>Inspired with this confidence,I fly to you, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother; to you do I come, before you I kneel, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in your mercy hear and answer me.\"When God was made man, it was she who gave voice to the Word. In the Magnificat, God the Holy Ghost, her mystical spouse, spoke though her. When Christ was a child, she was His voice. When Our Lord was a man, He spoke for himself, while his mother remained silent. After the Ascension, she again became His voice as she guided the infant Church through those perilous times. Over and over again the words of God came through her, for she is His Mediatrix of grace, the link between us and Him.</p><p>Vested with the almighty power of her Divine Son, Mary, imitating Him, visits the earth, going about doing good, granting petitions, supplying the needs of those who invoke her, and giving solace, comfort and aid to her children. She is indeed Our Lady of the Word; Mother of the Word Incarnate; \"And the Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us,\" through her \"Fiat.\"</p><p>As a consequence, even while on earth, His Mother's word had great influence upon Christ. \"They have no wine,\" uttered in behalf of the embarrassed newlyweds at Cana, was all that was necessary to bring forth her Sons' first miracle.</p><p>And so, down the ages, Mary hearkens to the words of her Calvary-born children and speaks in their behalf to Jesus. Her intercession, her word, her speech, is never in vain. Let us never cease to invoke this powerful protectress, who wants nothing more than to intercede for us, her children, before the throne of God.</p>"

It is 146 yards long and 47 yards wide, which made it one of the largest buildings constructed at that time in the Middle Ages.</p><p>During the Nine Years' War the entire town of Speyer was burned to the ground, and the heat from the inferno caused part of the nave to collapse.

    "Our Lady of St Fort Chartres": {
        "eng": "<p>The Roman General Julius Caesar wrote that the area around Chartres, in the land belonging to the Carnutes, was the yearly meeting place of the Druids. It is said that since pre-historic times they assembled there from all over Western Europe.</p><p>The Cathedral of Chartres is built entirely upon a large subterranean crypt which dates from the 11th century. The crypt is unusually large, which accounts for the wide nave of the present Chartres Cathedral. Few people who visit the cathedral ever think to enter the crypt, though it is here in the depths beneath the famous cathedral that one can see the foundation of the great pillars that uphold the soaring heights of the nave, and also where the well of Saint Fort is located.</p><p>The Well of Saint's Fort is from the ancient name of Locus Fortis, or The Strong Place. It used to be located outside the old, smaller church, and is where the bodies of the martyrs Saint Altin and Saint Eodald were thrown by the Vikings in a raid in the year 858. The well was filled in about the 17th century, but it has been restored, as the earth was removed again in 1901.</p><p>If one continues, and passes the well, they will come upon something that the very first Christians are said to have witnessed when they came to Chartres. They found there a statue of a woman seated upon a throne with a child on her knee, a statue that had been venerated by the Druids. It appears that they were aware of Isaiah's prophesy that a virgin would conceive and bear a son. The statue was described by a 17th century thus:</p><p>\"The Virgin sits on a chair, her Son sits on her knees and He gives the sign of blessing with His right hand. In His left hand He holds an orb. He is bare-headed and His hair is quite short. He wears a close-fitting robe girdled with a belt. His face, hands and feet are bare and they are of a shining grey-ebony color.</p><p>The Virgin is dressed in an antique mantle in the shape of a chasuble. Her face is oval, of perfect construction, and of the same shining black color. Her crown is very plain, only the top being decorated with flowers and small leaves. Her chair is one foot wide with four parts hallowed out at the back and carved. The statue is twenty-nine inches tall.\"</p><p>It is interesting to note that the eyes of the Divine Child were open, while the Madonna's eyes were closed. According to Cecil Headlam, the Druids \"intended by this device to signify that faith was still in darkness, and that she whom they worshipped was not yet born. But the eyes of the Child, whom she in the fullness of time should supernaturally conceive and bear, were open; for He was without beginning and without end, the Spectator of all time and all existence.\"</p><p>The statue survived the centuries until the year 1793, when it was burned during the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. The people rose up to defend their cathedral, and so the Cathedral of Chartres was not destroyed, although the crypt was used as a warehouse until the year 1857. The statue was then replaced with the copy that can currently been seen in the crypt.</p>"

The two galleys were named for Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Guidance.</p><p>The chief gunner on the Guadalupe was one Francis Lopez, a man given to all kinds of wickedness. He had only one soft spot in his hard heart, and that was for Our Lady of the Rosary. Wicked as he was, he never neglected this offering to the Mother of Mercy.</p><p>On the voyage in question, the Guadalupe struck a rock and sank and everyone had to swim for shore. Francis arrived safely, but promptly got embroiled in a free-for-all with the native galley slaves, who saw an opportunity to escape from the Spaniards. The slaves entrenched themselves behind the cliffs and rolled rocks down on their former masters. Francis was horribly wounded and left for dead, when the few survivors pulled away in a boat, sent from the Guidance.</p><p>For two weeks he lay helpless and in a frightful state from his wounds. He was surrounded by the dead, and deserted by the living. In his lucid moments he prayed not to to Our Lady of Succor, not to be delivered or for his heath to be restored, but for a priest. Francis was in no state to face God without confession, and he begged Our Lady of the Rosary to send him a priest.</p><p>Two weeks later, the other galley was in trouble and blown off its course. It was carried into the straits where the Guadalupe had gone down, and with all the efforts of the crew, it could not be gotten around the cape. Finally the captain gave up, dropped anchor, and sent the crew ashore for fresh water. One of the sailors heard someone calling his name.</p><p>The wounded man he found was almost too horrible to look upon, but his request was plain enough, \"For the love of God, get me a priest!\" The Franciscan chaplain of the Guidance was hastily summoned, and the man made his confession, and then died.</p><p>Favorable winds filled the sails of the Guidance, and in an hour the vessel was back on course. Back in Manilla, the sacristans were decorating the sanctuary for a feast. Dusting around the statue of Our Lady of the Rosary, one of the ladies noticed an odd fact.</p><p>\"His little shoes are wet and muddy,\" she said, pointing to the Infant, \"and Our Lady's skirts are damp and full of wet sand, as though she had been walking on the beach!\"</p><p>The prior, Father Michael Ruiz, was summoned to see the phenomenon. He confirmed that the Mother's robe and the Baby's shoes showed definite signs of a journey in a wet sandy place, and that the niche where the statue stood was perfectly dry. He carefully noted the day and the time, and summoned a visiting Franciscan who examined the statue and finally took the Baby's sandals to his room with him as a proof of the incident.</p><p>Weeks later when the Guidance came home, the story was put together. Our Lady of Succor had heard the cry of her wandering child, and no one ever doubted that the sand on her robe came from the beach where Lopez died, calling on her for help.</p>"

It is located a short distance from Dijon, as noted, and there is a Forest of Talon that can also be seen on the map. During the Middle Ages there was a castle of Talan that seems always to be mentioned with the castle of Dijon. Perhaps there was also once a chapel there to which this date refers, but I can find no other information.</p><p>For your edification, I offer the following segment from The City of God. </p><p>The three Divine Persons conferred with each other saying:</p><p>\"On earth the Word shall have a Mother without a father, as in heaven He has a Father without a mother. And in order that there may be the proper correspondence, proportion and consonance in calling God His Father and this Woman His Mother, We desire that the highest correspondence and approach possible between a creature and its God be established. Therefore at no time shall the dragon boast of being superior to this Woman, whom God will obey as His true Mother. This dignity of being free from sin is due and corresponds to that of being Mother of the Word, and it is in itself even more estimable and useful. It is a greater good to be holy than to be only mother; but all sanctity and perfection is nevertheless due to the motherhood of God. The human flesh, from which He is to assume form, must be free from sin. Since He is to redeem in it the sinners, He must not be under the necessity of redeeming His own flesh, like that of sinners. Being united to the Divinity His humanity is to be the price of Redemption, wherefore it must before all be preserved from sin, and We have already foreseen and accepted the merits of the Word in this very flesh and human nature. We wish that for all eternities the Word should be glorified through this tabernacle and habitation of the human nature.\"</p><p>\"She is to be a daughter of the first man; but in the order of grace She is to be singularly free and exempt from fault; and in the order of nature She is to be most perfect, and to be formed according to a special providence. And since the incarnate Word is to be the Teacher of humility and holiness and for this end is to endure labors, confounding the vanity and deceitful fallacies of mortals by choosing for Himself sufferings as the treasure most estimable in our eyes, We wish that She, who is to be his Mother, experience the same labors and difficulties, that She be singularly distinguished in patience, admirable in sufferings, and that She, in union with the Onlybegotten, offer the acceptable sacrifices of sorrow to Us for her greater glory.\"</p><p>\"This was the decree which the three divine Persons made known to the holy angels, exalting the glory and honor of their high and inscrutable judgments. And since His Divinity is a mirror in which He at the same time manifests new mysteries to the blessed who yield obedience, this explanation revealed in a new light the admirable order and marvelous harmony of His works. All this follows from that which we have said in the preceding chapters concerning the works of the Almighty in the creation of the angels, telling them to reverence as their superiors the incarnate Word and His most holy Mother.\"</p>"

With his savings he bought several small plots of land, and he is known to have owned some cattle, but he was not a rich man. He had three children named Sante, Antonello and Baptist.</p><p>It was a time when the faithful would often have religious artwork painted on the outside of their homes, and there were students of master painter Pietro Vannucci who would often do the work. On October 4rd, 1483, Mr. Santilli had an image of the Blessed Virgin with the Divine Child in her arms painted on the north-east wall of his residence. Interestingly, the original painting also depicted Saint Francis at the left of the Blessed Virgin. The painting was completed on the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi, but the image of Saint Francis disappeared under the new ornamentation in which the Madonna and her Child was later enclosed in the seventeenth century.</p><p>It was nearly two years later, on Friday, August 5, 1485, when there were those who saw tears of blood fall from the eyes of the Madonna. The date of the miracle is precisely confirmed by many contemporary documents of the municipal authorities, and there was also a notary of Trevi who recorded all of the miracles he witnessed, and those records can still be found in the archives of the city of Trevi.</p><p>News of the miracle caused considerable excitement, for here the image of Our Lady wept. Word of the miraculous event, which continued for some time, spread far and wide. These were years of famine, war, and pestilence, and the extraordinary event gave people a ray of hope and seemed to offset some of their many serious misfortunes.</p><p>People came from all over the region to see the bloody tears fall from the eyes of the Madonna, and not all of them were Catholics or believers. There were also those who doubted, but once they had seen for themselves, many believed. Some received the faith, and there were also incidents of miracles of healing before the image of the Madonna of Tears, because it was called that even then.</p><p>There was, of course, a great deal of speculation as to why this image of the Blessed Virgin was weeping tears of blood, and it was finally generally accepted that it was out of sympathy for the people who were suffering so much from the pestilence and famine.</p><p>So many came to witness the prodigy that it was necessary to hurry and build a small chapel on the 17th of August, which was only a few days after the event. On the 21st of the same month the first Mass was offered in the chapel with the permission of the bishop of Spoleto. The new temporary chapel was festively decorated with curtains and veils, donated by the faithful. The altar was covered with a tablecloth of green silk. The walls were covered with cloth of blue silk, and many candles were burning before the altar. Soon, permission was given for a daily Mass there, but because of the great crowds, plans were already underway to build a magnificent church to replace the chapel. Money was soon collected, and work was begun on the basilica on March 27th, 1487. It was completed on March 8th, 1489, and was then confided to the Olivetans.</p><p>Once the basilica was completed, that portion of the wall that had the portrait of the Madonna and Child was cut away and moved inside the basilica. Housing was also constructed for the Olivetans, although the buildings were eventually turned over to other religious orders.</p><p>The basilica is also the home of Perugino's famous 'The Adoration of the Magi' and Giovanni Spagna's 'Deposition from the Cross'.</p>"

He was quite successful, and with the support of Saint Achaire Noyon, set up a large bishopric bounded on the north by the Yser, the south by the Canche, and the east by the Lys rivers.

The work was completed so well that today archaeologists are struggling to piece together what can be found buried beneath the earth.

Neither of them had ever seen a statue before, and so thought it was a living being.</p><p>The sheep would not enter the cave, seemingly out of fear of the statue, so at first the two shepherds motioned for the stranger to go away. When the statue did not move or respond, one of the men picked up a rock to throw at it. Instantly his arms stiffened so that he could not move, and his arms began to throb in pain. The other shepherd moved in close to the statue, and although it seemed to watch him, yet still it neither moved nor spoke. Puzzled, he took out his knife and tried to cut its finger - but instead of marking the statue, his own finger received the wound he had attempted to inflict, and then began to bleed profusely! Terrified, the two men fled the scene, leaving their sheep and everything else behind them.</p><p>The men reported what had happened to their chief, relating their belief that a great god lived in the cave. The chief commanded them to bring this being to him. Overcoming their fear, the two shepherds returned to the cave and found the statue had not moved. When the first of them reached out to take hold of it, as soon as he had touched the statue he found his finger was instantly healed of the wound he had received.</p><p>The men reverently carried the statue to a house where their chief directed and tried to show it honor in the best way they knew how. A few nights later they were surprised to hear beautiful music, and to see strange beings, all glowing and alight, setting candles around the strange \"god\" and lighting them. The natives had never seen candles.</p><p>A special house was built for the statue, and for fifty years there was beautiful music, light, and a lovely fragrance surrounding the statue that no one could explain. The natives made offerings of fruit and flowers, and noted that the light \"beings\" kept the candles burning around the crude altar.</p><p>In 1520 a native boy was captured and taken to Spain; he returned after a few years, and told the natives about Christianity. When missionaries came, the people were prepared to receive them and the True Faith.</p><p>Christians who had recently arrived and lived on a nearby island, recognized whom the statue must represent. At first, they begged the natives of Tenerife to let them have it, though the pagan natives refused, claiming she had brought them good fortune. The Christians decided to steal the statue of Our Lady of the Candles, feeling it was only proper that it should be in Christian hands. They succeeded in their plan, and brought the statue to their church, setting it on the high altar and surrounding it with burning candles.</p><p>Returning in the morning, they found that the statue had turned its back to the congregation, and no amount of pulling could get it turned to the front again. A serious sickness then invaded the island, and, repentant and frightened, the Christians took the statue back. Surprisingly, the natives had not noticed that it had been taken. The incredible explanation was that another statue, and exact duplicate to Our Lady of the Candles, had stood in its place during the entire time the original had been away.</p><p>Not surprisingly, devotion to Our Lady of the Candles spread rapidly through Spanish countries to South America and the Philippines.</p><p>The original statue of Our Lady of the Candles was made of heavy reddish wood, which had never been identified. It is 3 \u00bd feet high. The eyes of the statue seem to follow the beholder, and the color of the cheeks sometimes changes. The hair is uncovered, golden and worn in braids. The Babe has a golden bird in its hands. Our Lady holds a candle in her hand.</p><p>Since there are no bees on the island, the candles are also a mystery. A few days before the feast of Candlemass in the year 1497, great quantities of a particularly pure wax were found at various places on the island. Several times since, the same thing has happened. People gather the wax and save it for pious souvenirs. It is sometimes found in the shape of loaves, weighing ten or twelve pounds. Another mystery concerns the candle stumps which even today are found near the cave. Some are set up on the rocks of the beach. Wax and wicks are of strange materials, which the good people of the neighborhood insist could only have come from heaven.</p>"

Dmitry (called Dmitry of the Don) Donskoy commanded the Russian forces in the battle, which one chronicle states numbered 400,000 men.

Mikhail was slain, but Dmitry continued to fight.</p><p>Dmitry was severely wounded as the battle seemed to turn against them, though he remained on the field and in command until victory was secured and he fell over from exhaustion and loss of blood.

For though she was the dawn of grace, the pure beginning of all creatures, the superior over them all, the prodigy of the divine perfections, the center of His love, the sphere of the omnipotence of God, who called God her Son and was called by Him His mother, she nevertheless humbled herself to the lowest place in all creation.\"</p><p>\"She, who enjoyed the highest position, exalted above all the works of God, so that no higher position was left for a mere creature, humiliated Herself so far as to judge herself unworthy of the least estimation, distinction or honor, not even of such as would befit the most insignificant of the rational creatures. Not only did she deem herself unworthy of the dignity of being the Mother of God and of all the graces connected therewith, but she did not esteem herself deserving of the air she breathed, of the support the earth gave to her footsteps, of the sustenance derived from it, or of any service or kindness at the hands of creatures; of all things she considered herself unworthy and she gave thanks for all, as if she were really so undeserving.\"</p><p>\"In order to say all in a few words: that a creature should not seek the honor which does not belong to it or which for some reason it does not merit, is not such a great humility, although the Most High in his infinite kindness accepts it and considers Himself under obligation to one who practices it in that way. But she, most admirably exceeding all this, while deserving all exaltation and majesty, humiliated herself more than all other creatures and sought neither honor nor exaltation. Thus Mary, holding worthily the dignity of Mother of God, annihilated herself, and by this very humility deserved anew and in justice to be raised to the dominion and sovereignty of all creation.\"</p>"

Saint Denis, to whom we owe a great deal of our traditional devotion to Mary, was the first Bishop of Paris. According to tradition he drove the demons from the Temple of Ceres, the pagan goddess of agriculture, and placed therein an image of the Madonna modeled after Saint Luke's famous painting. The Temple was henceforth dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whom Parisians have honored for centuries under the title of Our Lady of the Fields. It is said that a picture of the Blessed Virgin is still to be seen there, on a small stone, a foot square, which was made after that which Saint Denis brought to France.</p><p>This house, which is a Benedictine priory, was afterwards occupied by the Carmelites, who were received there in the year 604, and founded by Catherine, Princess of Longueville. It was the first occupied by those nuns in France; the mother Ann of Jesus, the companion of Saint Teresa, was its first superior.</p><p>If the Blessed Virgin were a goddess she would be a very human goddess  -  simple and approachable, forgetful of her privileges and of her beauty. Her constant humility adds to her charm. Saint Denis knew this well. He found her so gloriously beautiful that he gave to her the place in the temple  -  and in the hearts of the people  -  formerly held by the pagan goddess.</p><p>\"I am the Flower of the Fields,\" the Holy Ghost has the Blessed Virgin say. A flower of the fields has a simple beauty that charms us even more because it blossoms by itself without care or cultivation. Our Savior Himself marveled at such a flower and of it He spoke these words of praise that have been repeated through the centuries: \"See how the lilies of the field grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.\"</p><p>But lilies soon fade and roses are hardly open before they begin to shed their petals before the wind. The beauty of Mary is less perishable; it remains ever fresh and unchanged in the valley of our exile.</p>"

Thorn trees do not bloom in winter, but our Lady's devotee prayed that she might find a love-offering. Na\u00efve and childlike in her confidence in Mary, she was not surprised to find blossoms on a thorn tree. Some days later, she went at dusk to get another fresh spray from the obliging thorn-tree, and found it all alight; she was troubled as she went through the woods, fearing it might be the light from a robber's campfire. She peered through the bleak winter-branches at the blossoms swaying in the breeze. Hurriedly picking a branch she went home and told the chaplain her story.</p><p>He and an old servant went with her the following night, chanting hymns as they approached the radiant tree. The chaplain parted the branches and saw a small statue of Our Lady, surrounded by a circlet of blossoms on the branch. It was a small statue, not pretty, rudely carved of wood and painted in bright colors; yet there was no doubt about its identity as a statue of the Mother of God. They took it home, rejoicing and fixed a niche for it in the chapel. There the noble lady and her retinue watched and prayed until midnight. In the morning, however, the statue had returned to the thorn tree. The Lady feared in her humility that her own unworthiness sent the statue from her; but the chaplain assured her that Our Lady simply wanted to be honored in the place that she herself had chosen.</p><p>A chapel was built around the thorn-tree to Our Lady of the Flowering Thorn, and the statue left in its original spot. Its fame spread all over Europe, and for many years pilgrims turned from the more famous pilgrim roads to seek out the narrow gorge where Our Lady of the Thorn held court, and sprigs of the favored tree withered on many a chapel wall throughout Christendom. Nuns, too, came to the favored spot, and the noble Lady gave them her house for a cloister and built there an abbey church. She herself joined the nuns and after a holy life, died at the foot of Our Lady's altar. Now grasses creep for many centuries over the stones worn smooth by sandaled feet of consecrated nuns, and the pilgrims ways are lost in the brush and the thorn.</p><p>Still, each spring, till Time is no more, the thorn trees bloom, and white petals testify to those who will listen, to the tale that no scientist would believe, the story of Our Lady of the Flowering Thorn. If you wish to check on the details, you might go yourself to the forgotten valley near the highest peak of the Jura and walk among the ruins there. As you kneel on the grassy stone that once formed the arch above the chapel window, say a prayer to Our Lady for the one from whom I heard the tale, for me, and for all lovers and devotees of Mary.</p>"

He had no one to care for him, lived alone, and did not associate with any person; he walked with his eyes to the ground, but his heart in Heaven.</p><p>As the years went by, old and crippled as he was, he might be seen every evening hobbling toward the chapel of the Blessed Virgin where he spent most of the night in prayer after the villagers had returned to the warmth and security of their own homes. He was a simple man of the woods, and here where the chapel of Our Lady of the Forest was later built he slept in the open under an oak tree near a fountain.</p><p>Solomon loved to swing from the branches of a tree that hung over the fountain, all the while singing his praises to \"Ave Maria!\" at the top of his lungs. He begged for bread each day to obtain his meals, and in doing so he was often laughed at, jeered at and otherwise mistreated by the small boys. He was commonly known to one and all as \"The Fool of the Wood.\"</p><p>One day, while the villagers were on their way to the chapel, they found the old man in the snow dying of exposure. They tried to help him, but it was too late for their kindness, as the old man soon died with the words \"Ave Maria\" on his lips. The fool of the wood had finally gone to his Queen in Heaven. Legend further relates that he was buried in an out-of-the-way place in Lesneven, for he had no family to mourn him.</p><p>When spring came, a snow-white lily rose from the outcast's grave, and on the delicate petals of the lily, in letters of gold, the words \"Ave Maria!\" could be seen. The grave was opened, and it was soon discovered that the lily had taken root in the mouth of the penniless old hermit. News of the miracle drew crowds to the scene, and a church was built to honor Our Lady of the Forest. The gravesite of the simple hermit can still be seen nearby, and visited even in our day.

On October 16th, 1454, Blessed Margaret was present when her dying cousin, Sister Filipina, spoke aloud the names of the saints who came to assist her on her way to heaven. Sister Filipina revealed during that last ecstasy that in the future there would be terrible wars, and that there would be a monster who would rise in the East as a scourge of all mankind.

It was once the most celebrated shrine in Constantinople, and lies inside the high walls of the city, only a short distance from the Golden Horn. The church was begun by the Empress Pulcheria, and completed by her husband, the emperor Marcian. It was built upon the site of what was thought to be a sacred spring, the waters of which are still thought to have therapeutic value. The Emperor Leo I made several additions, including the Hagai Soros, which was actually a small chapel next to the church where the Holy Robe and Girdle of the Blessed Virgin Mary were kept in a silver and gold reliquary. The relics had been brought from Palestine in 458.</p><p>In the year 911 AD it was reported that there was a Marian apparition at this church. The city was under siege by a large Muslim army, so the citizens of Constantinople had recourse to Mary, praying for relief at the Blachernae church. Very early one morning the Blessed Virgin, preceded by a host of angels, was seen to enter through the church doors, escorted by Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Theologian. She advanced to the center of the church and knelt there to pray fervently with tears in her eyes. After a time she moved to the altar and continued praying before she removed Her veil and held it out over the faithful as She ascended back into heaven.

Their confidence was not in vain, for suddenly the night seemed to turn into day and they witnessed the Queen of Heaven descending to earth in majesty, sparkling like a light of heaven, brighter than the sun. Accompanied by a host of angels, Our Lady seemed to gird the town all round with a cord. Nothing can convey the feelings of joy and devotion with which the people of Valenciennes were seized at this sight. At one point they all bowed and asked the Blessed Virgin's blessing. Their Heavenly Mother did indeed bless them, and those who were sick recovered their health, and they inhabitants of Velenciennes have been forever freed from the plague.</p><p>The Blessed Virgin instructed the hermit to tell the people that they were to make a solemn procession, and then to do so every year.

The saint who first inhabited the hermitage of Einsiedeln, was a young lord of Suabia, named Meinrad, belonging to the illustrious family of the counts of Hohenzollern.</p><p>Gifted with that genius of reverie which still forms the prominent feature of the German character, Meinrad, when scarcely arrived at adolescence, loved to buy himself in the thickest parts of the woods, which then covered his country, and to entertain himself alone with God, by the sound of bubbling springs, flowing beneath the shade of oaks.</p><p>Oftentimes night overtook Meinrad attentively reading the Scriptures in an old book with golden clasps, which he had inherited from his fathers, or meditating profoundly on the miracles and benefits of the Blessed Virgin. His soul was elevated in solitude; taking pity on the world and its worthless goods, Meinrad made his vows in the Abbey of Richenau, which he quitted afterwards to settle in a small hermitage built on the top of Mount Etzel.</p><p>Meinrad spent seven years there; but the good odor of his virtues descended to the depths of the valleys; the shepherd and woodmen came to him, then the great lords, then the noble ladies, humbly to solicit his prayers and counsels. These acts of homage were a torment to the young hermit, who loved nothing but contemplative prayer and the peace of the woods; one night he secretly left his hermitage, carrying with him, as his sole possession, the statue of the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of the Hermits, the only ornament of his chapel, and took refuge in a forest of the canton of Schwytz, which bore the characteristic name of the Dark Forest.</p><p>Thirty-two years afterwards, Meinrad was assassinated by some wicked men, with whom he had shared the water from his fountain and the wild fruits of the forest; the birds of heaven pursued the murderers, who underwent the chastisement which their crime deserved. (They were betrayed by two ravens, who harassed them incessantly as far as Zurich; they even made their way through the windows of the inn which the assassins had entered, and did not leave them until they had been punished.)</p><p>After the tragic death of Meinrad, his cell, where miracles were wrought, was uninhabited for almost half a century. At the end of that time, a small society of hermits came and settled there under the care of Saint Benno, of the ducal house of Burgundy. Hence the surname of Our Lady of the Hermits, which was given to the chapel of Einsiedeln.</p><p>Saint Eberhard devoted his possessions, which were considerable, to building a monastery in this place, of which he was the first abbot.</p><p>The chapel of the Blessed Virgin, as it was in the time of Saint Benno, was placed in the great church of the convent, of which Saint Meinrad's cell formed the choir; the French destroyed this chapel, which had resisted the furious attempts of Protestantism; but God permitted that the miraculous statue of the Blessed Virgin should be saved in time. It was replaced in the church of Einsiedeln in 1803, with great solemnity, and in 1817 it recovered part of its ancient magnificence, thanks to the influx of the most distinguished artists, and the abundant alms of the faithful.

This very notion is refuted by Saint John, who begins his gospel:</p><p>\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.

The church dates back to about the year 320, when Saint Helena, the mother of the emperor Constantine, modified one of her rooms in the imperial palace to house the relics of the Passion of Christ that she had brought back to Rome from the Holy Land. Even though the church is located in Rome, it is said to be \"at Jerusalem\" due to the fact that the floor was covered with earth that had also been brought back from Jerusalem, meaning that the church was built upon the soil of Jerusalem.</p><p>Saint Helena travelled to the Holy Land in the year 326, founding churches at the places where Christ was born in Bethlehem, and from where he ascended into heaven. It shouldn't seem so remarkable that Helena was able to find the holy places such as the Cenacle, for many of the buildings still stood. Then, as now, the buildings were constructed of stone, and so they could not burn, as wood would only be found in furniture, doors and windows. It was also under Helena's direction that the Cenacle was purified, consecrated, and Mass said there once again. The Cenacle became the seat of the archbishop until the year 636 when the Arabs came with fire and sword.</p><p>There are many significant relics kept at the church, including pieces of the cross upon which Jesus suffered his Passion, two thorns from the Crown of Thorns, a piece of one of the nails that held Our Lord to the Cross. Other relics include a piece of the cross of the Good Thief, a bone from the finger of Saint Thomas that he had placed into the wound of Christ after His the Resurrection, and fragments of the pillar Christ was tied to when he was whipped, the Holy Sepulcher, the crib Jesus had used as a baby, and other fragments from the grotto where He had been born at Bethlehem. These relics can still be seen today.</p>"

Their patron was the Blessed Virgin Mary. Since the time of its humble beginnings in 1563, twenty-two Sodalists have become Popes. </p><p>After Fr. Leunis' death in 1584, Pope Gregory XIII canonically established the Sodality Group of the Roman College in his bull \"Omnipotentis Dei.\" The sodality of Fr. Leunis was declared to be the mother of all such subsequent sodalities. Having attained the status of Prima Primaria, it had gained the right to partner with other similar groups, and through that affiliation all could share in the indulgences and privileges of the Prima Primaria, with the General of the Society of Jesus having the authority to grant such an affiliation. These sodalities were established all over Europe, India and Asia, as well as in the Americas, and included both sexes. They reached their greatest number in the 17th century, when it was estimated that there were as many as 2500 such groups.</p><p>Pope Clement XIV suppressed the Society of Jesus, and separated the sodalities from their jurisdiction.

There had been an extremely strong earthquake on that day that was reported to have been felt throughout all of Europe. Cadiz is a seaport of Spain exposed to the Atlantic Ocean and was directly in the path of the tidal wave said to be more than 90 feet high. The recently reported tsunamis in Asia pale in comparison to that wave. Lisbon, with 275,000 inhabitants, was said to have lost 90,000 people and had 85% of its buildings destroyed from the wave. The water penetrated as much as 8 kilometers inland, mainly striking Portugal, Spain and Africa.</p><p>The townspeople of Cadiz were in terror and were on the point of abandoning the town when two unidentified men  -  thought later to be the patron saints of the city  -  closed the water gates and urged the people to go to the Capuchin Church of Our Lady of the Palm.

The priest calmly finished the Mass, seized a banner with a picture of Our Lady on it, and went out into the street where the wall of water was already advancing upon them. He planted the banner in the street almost in the shadow of the great wave and called out in a loud voice, \"Thus far, my Mother.\"</p><p>The water advanced as far as the banner, and then miraculously stopped its forward progression, even though up until that point it had destroyed everything in its path. Then, as the priest walked boldly forward toward the wall of water with the banner in his upraised hand, that gigantic wave receded from him and turned away from the face of Mary to return placidly to the ocean.</p><p>An anniversary procession was established, along with a confraternity of Our Lady of the Palm. With the exception of 1837, when there was a Civil War, the procession was held annually.

Mary was standing on a column of marble, and she gave St. James her effigy, requesting that he build a chapel in her honor. Saint James complied. To the small chapel has been added a large temple which has been called Our Lady of the Pillar. Throughout the years the kisses of the pilgrims have made a hole in the pedestal, so large that a man's head can rest therein.</p><p>Many miracles have been performed at the shrine of Our Lady of the Pillar: one in 1640 when the limb of a man, Juan, native of Colanda, was cured. In remembrance of the apparition of Our Lady, the people of Zaragossa made a vow in 1642 to honor always Mary, as the patroness of Zaragossa.</p><p>More than a hundred years ago, Zaragossa was besieged by a large French army. A few men and women with sixteen cannon and some shotguns, defended the town for two months. The French sacked the famous town, and took everything; but they did not dare touch the treasures of Our Lady of the Pillar. One of the generals boldly took one of the jewels to carry home to his wife, offering the Virgin in exchange a valuable gift. In the first battle, a cannon ball took off his leg. It was during this terrible siege that the people began to recite the verse so well known to the Spanish, \"The Virgin of the Pillar says she does not want to be French.

        "eng": "<p>At Toul, in Lorraine, there was a statue, which, according to an ancient tradition, informed a woman on September 20th in the year 1284, of an act of treachery which was being planned against the city.</p><p>The statue was called Our Lady of the Silver Foot, or Notre-Dame au pied d'argent in the native French. The faithful keep the memory of this stone statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was located just inside the entrance of the church and placed over a sculpted clam. In those days there would be a lamp burning before it on feast days, and almost every day the faithful offered small candles which they lit and rested on a circular iron candlestick that was placed before the statue. It was well known that several people who prayed before this statue were cured of various diseases, but the devotion and respect of the people toward this image grew more than ever at the time of the Bishop Conrad, because of the miracle that occurred in the following manner:</p><p>A woman named Helwide was in the Cathedral Saint-Etienne de Toul praying to the Blessed Virgin for consolation and the repose of the souls of her husband and daughter who had recently died. It was about midnight, when the canons were praying Matins, that the Blessed Virgin Mary suddenly appeared to her.</p><p>The Virgin Mary ordered Helwide to go immediately to find a man named Rimert, who was the guardian of \"The Door to the Chair.\" The Door to the Chair gave access to the Castrum, a little entrance to the city near Tanner Street. Helwide was urged to go quickly, for an enemy proposed to enter the city by the door to set their homes on fire and fill the streets with blood.</p><p>Regaining her senses after the vision, Helwide got up feeling very puzzled. She was hesitant about what she should do, though as Rimbert's home was not far distant and was on her way home anyway, she decided she would indeed go there.</p><p>No sooner had Helwide stepped out of the church than she met the night-watch on patrol. She told them the tale of her vision, and they responded by mocking her and making derogatory jokes. Despite this, two of them still decided to follow and actually see what would happen if Helwide could find the porter she sought.</p><p>The pair arrived with Helwide at the house and simply thrust the door open. Rimbert sat on his bunk, seeming startled, yet as if expecting the visit. Helwide briefly stated the purpose of her visit, and Rimbert exclaimed, \"I had precisely the same vision and the same warning! I do not know if it occurred in my sleep or in the state of wakefulness, but I have been told that the statue will move her foot in testimony of the truth!\"</p><p>At these words, all those present were seized with a great desire to see such a prodigy. With a rush they ran to the Cathedral and removed the candles and all that stood before the image. To their disappointment they found that the Virgin's feet remained mostly hidden beneath the folds of the clothing of the statue as before.</p><p>In the interim, several scholars and some laymen who were called to see the wonder, arrived on the scene. Seeing that nothing was apparently going to happen, they began cursing all the rest as senseless interpreters of dreams. At they stood not far from the statue, many of them fell silent as they saw the statue suddenly move as an entire foot of the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared from beneath the folds of her garment.</p><p>Terrified, but convinced, this time they all agreed to announce the peril which they now knew actually threatened them. Quickly rendering their thanks to Mary, they agreed to defend the city and call for reinforcements. They arrived just in time to take up their positions to defend the entrance to the city with the assistance of the Episcopal palace guards.</p><p>A tremendous struggle occurred when the butchers broke down the door and entered the courtyard, but the defenders were committed to the fight and held their own. When reinforcements arrived, the invaders fell to the last man.</p><p>To perpetuate the memory and recognize the protection granted to them by the Blessed Virgin Mary, the people of Toul had a shoe of pure silver made to cover the foot on the Blessed Virgin's statue. From that time on the statue was known as Our Lady of the Silver Foot. They also hung on the wall of the cathedral a picture which represented the heavenly vision, and Mary was declared patroness of the city.</p><p>The image of Our Lady of the Silver Foot was venerated in the city and the surrounding area, and in case of the threat of any public calamity, the Blessed Virgin was invoked and henceforth the statue would be carried in procession throughout the streets of the city. The magistrates themselves considered it an honor to take the statue upon their own shoulders. Pilgrimages were made to Our Lady of the Silver Foot; prayers answered, graces bestowed and miracles wrought.</p><p>The original statue of Our Lady of the Silver Foot was destroyed during the ravages of the French Revolution, and was replaced later by a modern statue that was stolen in the 1980's. The Gothic cathedral was repaired after being damaged during the French Revolution, but still awaits repair after the damage caused when it was struck during an aerial bombardment in the Second World War. There was once also a monastery at Toul, but no trace of it remains. </p>"

The statue earned its unique title through many spectacular miracles. It is best known for the fact that life was restored to several persons who had been murdered. Interestingly, in memory of these miracles, those who had been raised from the dead would bear, from that time forward, a red mark upon their throats, like that which was hen seen on the throat of the image. This information comes to us from the Cistercian Chronicles.</p><p>King Afonso I, the Conqueror, (also known as Afonso Henriques), was the first king of Portugal and a lifelong sworn opponent of Islam. He spent 46 years as king of Portugal waging war against the Moors in order to drive the invaders from his land.</p><p>He was also known for his piety and great love for God. A relative of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, he bestowed many privileges and benefits to the religious orders and built Alcobaca Monastery for the Cistercian Order.He was responsible for the foundation of several monasteries and convents, and was favorable especially toward the Cistercians.</p><p>King Afonso was not a stranger to the miraculous. Before the battle of Ourique, when Afonso was to meet in battle an overwhelming army of five Moorish kings, he prayed that God would give him the strength to defeat his enemies.</p><p>He fell asleep, and in his dream a mysterious old man entered his tent to him to advise him that it was God's will that he would be victorious in the coming engagement against the Moors. Afterward, he was awakened by his guard, who told him there was an old man waiting outside who wished to speak to him. King Afonso bade him enter, and was started to see it was the old man from his dream.</p><p>The old man said:</p><p>\"Alfonso, have confidence, because you will conquer and destroy these infidel kings, you will smash their power and the Lord will appear to you.\"</p><p>He then instructed the king to leave his camp that night, without any attendant, at the sound of the church bell ringing from the old man's hermitage.</p><p>It was dark, and the night seemed ominous and strangely vacant when King Afonso heard the mournful toll of the bell. He took up his sword and shield and mounted his horse to ride alone from the camp. A heavy cloud cover blotted out the light of the moon and stars when suddenly an intense beam of light illuminated the night from the East, and in this resplendent light a Cross appeared bearing the crucified Christ. King Afonso dismounted and prostrated himself before the image of the King of Kings when he heard a voice telling him that he would indeed be victorious against the Moors. Trusting in God, King Afonso went into battle and won an impressive victory against the five kings. It is said that Saint James, the Moorslayer, appeared during the battle to guarantee the victory of the Christian army.</p><p>King Afonso went on to win other great battles against the Moors, doubling the size of the kingdom of Portugal that he had founded.</p>"

August 5, 352, snow fell during the night in Rome.</p><p>There lived in the Eternal City a nobleman, John and his childless wife, who had been blessed with much of this world's goods. They chose the Mother of God as the heir to their fortune, and at the suggestion of Pope Liberius, prayed that she might make known to them how to do this by a particular sign.</p><p>In answer, the Virgin Mother during the night of August 5, appeared to John and his wife and also to the Holy Father, Pope Liberius, directing them to build a church in her honor on the crown of the Esquiline Hill. And what would be the sign that John and his wife had requested?</p><p>\"Snow will cover the crest of the hill.\"</p><p>Snow rarely falls in Rome, but the flakes fell silently during that night, blanketing the peak of the historic hill. In the morning the news quickly spread and crowds gathered to throng up the hill and behold the white splendor. The snow had fallen in a particular pattern, showing the outline of the future church. When it became known that the snow was a sign from Mary, the people spontaneously added another to her long list of titles, Our Lady of the Snows.</p><p>The church built there is now known as Saint Mary Major. It is the focal point of devotion for many of Mary's millions of children, one of the most popular churches in the world. There Mary has been pleased to secure various and many blessings as numerous and varied, as the flakes of snow that fell that August night.</p><p>The church built by John and his wife in honor of Our Lady of the Snows, restored and enlarged at various times was known by different names: the Basilica of Liberius, Saint Mary of the Crib because it enshrines relics of Christ's Crib; lastly, Saint Mary Major, to distinguish it from the many other Roman churches dedicated to the Mother of God; Major, means Greater. There is an image revered as Our Lady of the Snows, which is believed to have been produced by St. Luke the Apostle.</p><p>Saint Mary Major is one of the four basilicas in which the pilgrims to Rome must pray in order to gain the indulgences of the Holy Year. Most fitting do we call Mary Our Lady of the Snows. The white blanket of that August night symbolizes Mary, pure as the driven snow; her blessings and graces, numerous and varied as the falling snowflakes.</p><p>Science tells us that every snowflake is different in form and make-up: size, outline, structure, ornamentation, are all without limit, infinite in wondrous beauty, startling complexity, perfect symmetry as they fleet, dancing down from the sky. What a wonderful figure of the blessings Mary obtains for us! Snow changes the face of the earth, painting even a field of mud with a white coat. The grace of God won through prayer to Mary, also changes the face of the earth. Snow preserves the heat of the earth, protects vegetation, supplies moisture with slow effectiveness.</p><p>Grace serves similar purposes: it preserves the warmth of God's love in our hearts; it protects the soul from the chill of temptation and sin; it nourishes the soul with new life. We see a further symbolism in this feast. There are millions living in lands of ice and snow who have not come to the knowledge of Mary and her Divine Son. We might ask that with the actual snowflakes, she shower down upon them the graces of the True Faith.</p><p>In particular may that land where snow falls long and heavily, Russia, come to share in a fall of graces through prayer to her whom we honor on August fifth as \"Our Lady of the Snows.\"</p>"

        "eng": "<p>Aquileia was Roman city that was founded as a stronghold along the Natissa River on the frontier of the growing Roman Empire in about the year 180 BC. It soon became an important trade center, and there were many roads that were soon built leading to this city. In time, peoples of all nations and races began to settle there and produce goods for trade.</p><p>The city maintained its importance, and centuries later the Emperor Constantine was known to have visited Aquileia on several occasions, as it had become recognized as one of the greatest cities in the world. Such prominence attracted Attila the Hun, who attacked the city twice. In the year 452 he took the city, demolishing it to the point that none of the structures still stood after his passing.</p><p>The city was promptly rebuilt, however, as the residents returned from hiding. Charlemagne made the priest at Aquileia a new patriarch, though eventually that Patriarchate was passed to the Republic of Venice, a city that was founded by the people of Aquileia during the time of Attila's second invasion.</p><p>The present Cathedral at Aquileia, the location of the miracle of Our Lady of the Star, was built by the Patriarch Poppo in the 11th century, and rebuilt in the beautiful Gothic style in the 14th century. As the cathedral was built over the remains of the previous church, the floor has magnificent mosaic paves dating from the 4th century, as well as ancient frescos. </p><p>This feast day, Our Lady of the Star, is so called because of a miracle that occurred at Aquileia when Saint Bernardine arrived and began to preach. It is affirmed that a bright light similar to a star was seen on the head of St Bernardine, a star that was easily visible even during the hours of daylight when he preached at Aquileia, applying to the Blessed Virgin that passage of the Apocalypse where it is said that there were twelve stars on her head.</p><p>From the book of Revelation:</p><p>\"A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. She was with child and wailed aloud in pain as she labored to give birth. Then another sign appeared in the sky; it was a huge red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven diadems. Its tail swept away a third of the stars in the sky and hurled them down to the earth. Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth, to devour her child when she gave birth. She gave birth to a son, a male child, destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod. Her child was caught up to God and his throne. The woman herself fled into the desert where she had a place prepared by God, that there she might be taken care of for twelve hundred and sixty days. Then war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels battled against the dragon. The dragon and its angels fought back, but they did not prevail and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The huge dragon, the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, who deceived the whole world, was thrown down to earth, and its angels were thrown down with it. Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: \"Now have salvation and power come, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Anointed. For the accuser of our brothers is cast out, who accuses them before our God day and night. They conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; love for life did not deter them from death. Therefore, rejoice you heavens, and you who dwell in them. But woe to you, earth and sea, for the Devil has come down to you in great fury, for he knows he has but a short time.\"</p><p>Saint Bernardine preached that this glorious woman is the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was in the mind of God before the time of creation, and who is the Mother of God and of the Church, as well as the Queen of Heaven. The miracle of Our Lady of the Star seems to confirm Saint Bernadine's teaching that Pope Saint Pius X and other popes later affirmed.</p> "

It is known for certain that it was during the reign of King Don Juan IV when the University of Coimbra and all of the bishops approved his initiative of offering the Kingdom of Portugal to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception. The image of Our Lady at Vila Vicosa was proclaimed Patroness of Portugal on March 25th, 1646. Since that time no Portuguese monarchs of the House of Braganca ever again put the royal crown on their own heads.

The original statue of Our Lady was found on the Welsh coast, standing near the sea. It was a simple little statue of the Blessed Virgin, her Son on her arm, with a burning taper in her other hand. Devotion to the image of Our Lady of the Taper began immediately.</p><p>An examination of the statue by Bishop Barlow was made on March 16th, 1538, and states in part:\"the image now situated in the church of Cardigan which is used for a great pilgrimage to this present day was found standing upon the river Teifi and her son upon her lap and the same taper burning in her hand. The said image was carried to Christ Church of Cardigan and the image would not tarry there but was found three or four times in the place where is now built the Church of Our Lady, and the taper burning in her hand which continued burning the space of nine years without wasting.\"</p><p>As Bishop Barlow noted, several times the statue of Our Lady of the Taper was brought into Christ Church, Cardigan, but always it was mysteriously returned to the seashore. In 1158 a special chapel was finally built to accommodate Our Lady of the Taper, as the people began to understand that the Virgin Mary wished it to be there. The shrine is known to have been a place of pilgrimage long before the twelfth century.</p><p>The first church was part of a Benedictine Priory, and the monks lived there until 1538 when the infamous Oliver Cromwell had the monks evicted and destroyed the ancient statue, as he had ordered all images of Our Lady should be sent to London to be destroyed, and the devotion was unfortunately all but forgotten.</p><p>A Bishop Petit sought to restore the shrine in the last century, and Dom Vincent Dapre, OSB, was commissioned to create a new statue using the only known description of Our Lady of the Taper, written by an Anglican, the Reverend Silas M. Harris. In 1956 the new state was placed in Cardigan as thousands of the faithful gathered to witness in a great procession. That statue, however, was not robust enough to withstand the years, and a bronze statue was commissioned and blessed in 1986. On the 18th of May 1986, Pentecost Sunday, it was solemnly reinstated in the church. Pope John Paul II lit a blessed taper he had placed in the statues hand.</p>"

As they approached the light they saw that it was actually a thorn bush fully engulfed in flames, and they discovered a statue of the Blessed Virgin standing unharmed in the midst of the flames. In fact, though the fire burned brightly, the branches and leaves of the thorn bush were unaffected by the flames.</p><p>The miracle continued all that night and into the next day, and news of the miracle spread quickly. Mobs of people crowded around the burning bush that was so reminiscent of the one witnessed by Moses on Mount Horeb. The Bishop of Chalons, Charles of Poiters, also witnessed the burning bush and the miraculous statue  -  both still unaffected by the fire.</p><p>When the flames finally did die down, the bishop reverently took the statue and carried it in his own hands to the nearby Chapel of Saint John. On the very site of the miracle, construction of a church was begun for the enshrinement of the miraculous statue.

The Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa, built in the year 1123 by these Crusaders, still stands on the site of the original sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin that was dedicated by Saint Peter. It is remembered that the Emperor Constantine looked favorably upon the city because of his love for the Blessed Virgin Mary and the devotion to her by the faithful at Tortosa.</p><p>By all appearances the church of Our Lady was as much of a fortress as it was a church, and indeed there were once towers surrounding the structure, two of which have survived the centuries. The fa\u00e7ade of the church, which appears almost Romanesque in style, has five arched window openings that are well above ground level, and there is a centrally located doorway. Once inside, however, the structure looks more like a church, as there are graceful arches, columns and a vaulted ceiling.</p><p>Since the church doubled as a fortification, the Crusaders were able to hold it even after Tortosa was taken by Saladin in the year 1188. Saladin, who was able to unify the warring Muslim factions, made them into a robust army and won an important battle at Hattin over the Crusaders, capturing nearly all of their holdings, save for those near the coasts.

Don Bosco never revealed all that Our Lady had told him in the several visions that preceded this, but he did reveal that she asked him to build a great shrine and that it would be a source of grace to all who came there to pray. The saints do not ask as many questions as other people do; he simply got permission, hunted up an architect who was willing, in the coldly realistic nineteenth century, to begin a church on 8 cents, and said when the work was finished that he had been paid every cent owing to him; but, that he had been confronted in the beginning by a man who many people said was completely mad. The architect must have had real faith even to listen to Don Bosco.</p><p>Like everything else accomplished by the great Saint of Turin, the building was beset with difficulties. No one could understand why he insisted on naming it for Our Lady; even his own fellow priests. The money to pay for the project did not come in by the thousands of dollars, or even by the hundreds, but by the penny. Every stone in the building, every bit of decorations, was a gift of love, and sacrifice from some grateful person who had benefitted from Our Lady's help. The completed building is a testimonial of miracles and a shrine of beauty fit to stand with the world's finest.</p><p>The curious thing about Don Bosco's shrine to Our Lady, and the one that should cause us thought, is the story of the right-hand tower. There is a large central dome, and on each side of it, a smaller one. On top of left-hand one is an angel holding a banner. The right-hand dome is built the same, but its decoration is an angel offering a crown to Our Lady. One who saw the original sketches of the Church, drawn out in Don Bosco's own hand, saw on the right-hand tower, a date 19.., indicating that at some time in this warring century there would be a victory over evil to correspond with Lepanto. Our Lady often tells her secrets to the saints, and apparently Don Bosco knew the name and the place, and thought it better not to reveal what he knew. Our Lady of the Tower Secret would take care of it in time; and the left-hand angel bearing a banner labeled LEPANTO would have a counterpart, if mankind proves worthy.</p><p>Don Bosco's church with Our Lady of the Tower was raised to the rank of a basilica by Pope Pius X, Saint Pope Pius X.</p>"

He placed it in a church of Fagamusta, where it remained a center of devotion to the Virgin for 400 years.</p><p>Then in 1113, during the reign of Baldwin, King of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem there was established in Jerusalem, the Order of Templars. Around 1130, a group of crusaders, knights and nobles on Cyprus, decided they would join the Order of Templars and forthwith took ship to Jerusalem, and with them they took the image of the Virgin and Child.</p><p> The image seems to have remained in Jerusalem for almost 150 years. Then, after the failure of the 7th Crusade, one of the Knights Templar  -  said to have been Guerrogio of Pisaset, sailed for Italy taking the image with him, possibly to save it from profanation by the Turks. During the course of the voyage, the ship ran into a terrific storm and soon it appeared that the ship and all on board were doomed. But the knight did not despair  -  he prayed fervently to the Blessed Mother and solemnly promised her, if they weathered the storm he would enshrine her image on the first land they would touch.</p><p>The storm died down and eventually the ship landed at Trapani, Sicily. The story of the miraculous image of Our Lady of Trapani quickly spread among the people of Trapani and they decided to erect a church in Mary's honor. Work soon began and the church was completed around 1332. It was rebuilt in 1760.</p><p>At one end of the church behind the main altar, there is a fine chapel and in it stands the venerated image of the Madonna of Trapani, a statue of marble, depicting the Virgin with the Infant on her left arm.

To her he turned, promising to lead a better life in the future, if this loving Mother would deliver him from his miserable condition. In an instant, Jerome beheld his prison filled with light, and the Virgin Mary descending from Heaven to loose with her own hands, the chains with which he was bound. Moreover, she handed him a key with which to open the door of the prison and escape. Eluding his captors, he directed his steps toward Treves, to the shrine of the Mother of God.</p><p>When he arrived in Treves, he prostrated himself before the image of Our Lady and laid on her altar the instruments of his torture. He then retired to a life of penance until God sent him companions to start his order, also known as the Company of the Servants of the Poor. He was especially concerned with the souls of homeless orphans, and so he established orphanages to care for them. He always exhorted not only these, but all with whom he came in contact, to reverence the powerful Queen of Heaven by often reciting the \"Haill Holy Queen\" and other Marian hymns. St. Jerome Emilani died a holy death in 1537 while caring for the victims of plague. Pope Benedict XIV proclaimed him a saint in the year 1767.</p><p>The cathedral of Treves is also famous as the location where the \"Holy Coat\" is exposed for veneration. This is the same that is piously believed to have been worn by Our Lord Jesus Christ, and is the seamless garment for which the soldiers cast lots on Calvary during His passion and death.</p>"

To atone for this, a shrine to the Mother of the true God was erected and has remained a place of pilgrimage and of miracles.</p><p>Among the many miracles which Mary is accredited with at this shrine, two are mentioned in the life of Saint Heribert. During the time of a great drought, the saint went to the altar of Mary, and resting his head in his hands, he prayed long and fervently. When he left the church, rain was falling in torrents. Another time his prayers induced Mary to spare the people from the plague then raging all around.</p><p>Saint Heribert, born in 970, was the Archbishop of Cologne, and was revered as a saint even during his lifetime. He founded the Abbey of Deutz, a Benedictine monastery in Cologne, though I can find no reference to Our Lady of Tru or Trut, and there is currently no town in Germany of that name.</p><p>\"Among the more rare and excellent privileges of most pure Mary, the chief one is, that She is Mother of God, which is the foundation of all the rest. The second is, that She was conceived without sin. The third, that She enjoyed many times the beatific vision in this mortal life, and the fourth is that She continually saw clearly the most holy soul of her Son and all its operations for her imitation. She had it present to her eyes, as a most clear and pure mirror, in which She could behold Herself again and again in order to adorn Herself with most precious gems of virtue, made in imitation of those seen in that most holy Soul. There She saw it united with the divine Word and She exercised her humility in seeing how much her own human nature was inferior to that of Christ.\"</p><p>\"She perceived with the clearest insight the acts of gratitude and praise, with which the soul of Christ praised the Almighty for having been created out of nothing as the rest of the souls, and for the graces and gifts, with which it was endowed above others as a creature; and especially, for having been elevated and made godlike by the union of the human nature with the Divinity. She pondered over his petitions, prayers and supplications to His eternal Father for the human race; and how in all his other activity He prepared Himself for its Redemption and instruction, as the sole Redeemer and Teacher of man for eternal life.\"</p>"

At the first entrance of the heavenly Lady with her Divine Son and Saint Joseph, She prostrated Herself to the ground, kissing it in profound humility and lovingly thanking the Most High for having secured them this place of rest after their prolonged and laborious journeying.\"</p><p>\"She adored the immutable being of God in this prostration, dedicating all that She was to do in this place to His honor and worship. Interiorly She made a sacrifice of all her powers and faculties, offering to assume readily and with joy all the labors by which the Almighty could be served during her exile; for in her prudence She foresaw and affectionately embraced them all. By means of her divine knowledge She set a great value on sufferings; understanding how highly they are esteemed at the divine tribunal, and how her most Holy Son looked upon them as a rich treasure and inheritance.\"</p><p>\"Having performed these exalted acts of devotion, She set about humbly to clean and arrange the poor little house, borrowing the instruments for this purpose. Although our heavenly strangers were thus sufficiently provided with the shelter of bare walls, they were in want of all else pertaining to the sustenance and comfort of daily life. As they now lived in an inhabited country, the miraculous assistance, which they had enjoyed in the desert through the ministry of the angels, failed them; and the Lord left them to the last resource of the poor, namely, the begging of alms. Having come to these straits of suffering hunger, Saint Joseph went forth to seek this kind of assistance for the love of God; giving thereby an example to the poor not to complain of their affliction and, all other means failing, not to be ashamed to have recourse to this expedient. For so early the Lord of all creation allowed Himself to fall into this extreme of being obliged to beg for his sustenance, in order that He might have an occasion to return the alms a hundredfold.\"</p><p>\"During the first three days of their arrival in Heliopolis, just as in other places of Egypt, the queen had for Herself and for her Onlybegotten no other sustenance than what was begged by His foster father Saint Joseph. When he began to earn some wages by his work, he made a humble couch for the Mother and a cradle for her Son; while he himself had as a resting place only the bare ground; for the house was without any furniture until by his own labor he succeeded in making some of the most indispensable pieces for the convenience of all three.\"</p>"

    "Our Lady of the Valley": {
        "eng": "<p>The Sicilian shrine to Our Lady of the Valley, or of the Green Valley, (Our Lady of Valverde) is said to have originated about the year 1040.</p><p>According to tradition, a soldier named Dionysius remained behind on the island of Sicily to engage in banditry, having been enticed by the wealth on the island and his greed for the money he felt he could easily steal from others. Assault, theft and murder meant nothing to him. Dionysius found a cave in which to hide, and then lurked in the shadows of the thick woods along the path that led from Catania to Aci. Dionysius was so active that this region near Mount Etna soon became infamous as the scene of robberies, violence and even murder.</p><p>At that time there was a certain man named Giles who lived in the city of Catania. In the course of business it became necessary for him to make the dangerous trip to Aci. Now, while Giles was aware of the danger, he was a pious man who was greatly devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and he was absolutely convinced that she would watch out over him on his journey.</p><p>As Giles passed through the wood beneath Mount Etna, (which is actually a volcano) a bandit barred his way and threatened his life with a dagger.</p><p>Suddenly the earth shook violently and a globe of blinding light appeared nearby. From within the light a woman's voice could be heard:</p><p>\"Dionysisus, Dionysius, do not touch my devotee.\"</p><p>The assassin's arm was frozen by the command. He turned and looked around at the light.</p><p>\"Lay down that weapon  -  and cease this life of banditry.\"</p><p>At these words Dionysius saw in a flash the monstrosity of what had been his life passing before his eyes. Throwing away his knife, he humbly acknowledged the errors of his former life and prostrated himself at the feet of his intended victim, begging his forgiveness.</p><p>Dionysus retreated alone to his cave to weep over his sins. Knowing his sincerity, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to him where he lived to comfort him. She urged him to trust in the goodness and mercy of God and go at once to confession. She also requested that a church be built on the hill of Valverde with the wealth Dionysius had obtained through his life of crime.</p><p>Within a few days word got out about what had happened, and the faithful from Aci processed to the hill of Valverde. Once on the hill they observed a noisy flock of cranes hovering in the sky before landing on a particular clearing nearby. Taking it as a sign, the bandit turned hermit began the work of constructing the chapel on that very spot. Although he began working immediately, and with impressive fervor, progress soon came to a halt due to the lack of a water supply.</p><p>Dionysius turned in prayer to the Virgin Mary, who once again appeared to order that a pickaxe be used to strike at the base of the rock forming the entrance to the bandit's cave. The result of the blow was a trickle of water that formed a pool sufficient not only for the continuation of the work, but also proved to be miraculous, as it soon became a source of healing for many of the sick who came and drank there. So many people came to assist that the work that had begun in the year 1038 was finished only two years later.</p><p>Dionysius kept the faith and continued to live on Valverde as a hermit. One night he was rapt in prayer when he was struck by an intense beam of light and saw a cloud in which the Madonna appeared surrounded by heavenly angels. The light dispersed as the cloud rose toward heaven, revealing a magnificent image of the Blessed Virgin and her Divine Son imprinted on the rough wall of a pillar of the church.</p><p>The image, now known as Our Lady of the Valley, depicts the Virgin Mary seated and wearing a robe with gold accents. Her head is covered with a veil, although Mary's hair can be seen framing her face. With her right hand she holds the Divine Child, who is seated upon a red and gold cushion. He has curly hair, and is dressed in a white tunic. His right hand is raised in blessing, while the other rests upon a small crane that seems to hide behind the Virgin's left hand.</p><p>In the year 1565 a group of Christian soldiers stopped here to invoke the aid of Our Lady of the Valley while on their way to the island of Malta. Suleiman the Magnificent was about to lay siege to the island fortress with countless thousands of his finest warriors, while only 600 knights of St. John would stand against them to defend the stronghold. These Christian soldiers were the same who would later operate the cannon that fired the round that mortally wounded the infamous pirate commander Dragut Rais. A votive offering of two iron cannon balls now hang to the left of the altar as testimony and thanksgiving for the assistance of the Mother of God during that siege.</p><p>The feast of Our Lady of the Valley is kept throughout three dioceses of Sicily.</p>"

The oldest documents preserved date from the thirteenth century, and tell how, according to tradition, the original image was found by a thief who later converted and became a hermit.</p><p>There was a thief named Nuno Onez, who was a hardened criminal and a \"man of licentious life and dedicated to looting.\" One day, however, upon hearing the prayer of a man who was to be his next victim, he was touched by Divine grace and repented of his many crimes, turning to the Blessed Virgin Mary to help him change his life. One day while he was praying an angel appeared to him to tell him to go to Valvanera and search for an oak that stood out from the rest, with a fountain that gushed at its feet and surrounded by swarms of bees. There, in the branches of a strong and noble oak, in the presence of a fountain of pure and clear water, the trunk of which was overflowing with the sweetness of honey, he would find an image of the Mother of God, the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p><p>Nuno went to the place with a priest on the following Sunday, and found the image, just as the angel had said. The statue had probably been hidden there when the Moslems invaded the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century. In that place, in the last third of the ninth century, he began to build a place of worship that became known as the chapel of Santo Cristo. Soon there was a small group of hermits who met to pray about this image, men who eventually adopted a regular life inspired by the rule of Saint Benedict. Thus, this small shrine is believed to have given rise to the Monastery of Valvanera, where the Virgin is currently venerated.</p><p>Valvanera Monastery is surrounded by a forest near the town of Anguiano in the valley of the Sierra Demand La Rioja. Its name derives from the Latin \"Vallis Venaria,\" which literally means: \"Valley water veins.\" The first Abbot was a man named Don Sancho in the year 990.</p><p>Our Lady apparently has a preference for oak trees, since this is one of several statues found in or on an oak tree. On that very spot today is seen the magnificent church which Alphonsus IV, King of Castile, built in honor of the Mother of God in 1073, and which houses the image.</p><p>She, the valiant woman of Scripture, desired her children, her clients and her devotees to share in a spiritual manner, in the strength and the power of this mighty tree, which is certainly a symbol of her.</p>"

The dome is said to be the largest free-standing dome since ancient times, and is 348 feet high. It provides for a wonderful view of the city of Florence, and is a true triumph of 15th century engineering. The problem was that the dome was also expected to be 150 feet wide, and even those building the cathedral had no idea how they would go about spanning the space when they got to it, for it was far larger than any attempted since the days of antiquity with the great Roman engineers. The problem was put off for a later generation.</p><p>It's hard to believe that such a design problem was left to the last minute, but fortunately, there was one man capable of the job. His name was Filippo Brunelleschi, and his work became the future emblem of the city of Florence.</p><p>Consider that the builders did not even have the money to afford the massive supports and scaffolding that was thought to be necessary to even begin work on the dome. One suggested solution was a proposal to fill in the space with dirt, and then pile it up in the shape of a dome which they could build around. To save the expense of removing the dirt after the dome was built, coins could be placed here and there in the dirt pile, and the poor invited in to look for the money, if they were also willing to take out the dirt they had dug through.</p><p>But Brunelleschi understood the secret of Rome's Pantheon. He began by building the outer ribs to support and distribute the weight, and instead of heavy stone, used interlocking bricks, which were lighter and more solid. No scaffolding was required, as the builders used chains attached to the dome they were building to suspend themselves in place to work. Even so, it took sixteen years to complete, but it was a huge advance in engineering for that time.</p><p>The city of Florence recognized the genius of Brunelleschi, for after his death he was buried directly beneath the dome he had created. He remains the only person ever buried in the vaulted cathedral dome.</p>"

Viterbo itself currently has 34 separate parishes, with 8 religious houses for men and 18 houses for sisters. I can find no reference to Our Lady of the Vine, or Madonna della Vito, anywhere in the entire region of Tuscany.</p><p>I found two references to Dominican convents. The first was Our Lady of the Oak, or Madonna della Quercia, which also has a Dominican convent attached.  The second was Santa Maria dei Gradi, of which only the church still remains. It was one of the earliest Dominican convents, although it is now used mainly as a retreat house.</p><p>The Heavenly Mother, like all mothers, does not discriminate between children, for her help is for everyone. We now continue with Our Lady of the Oak, which is almost surely the place referred to be the good abbot as Our Lady of the Vine.</p><p>At one time in Viterbo there was a certain man named Mastro Baptist Magnano Iuzzante, who was a very God-fearing devotee of the glorious Virgin Mary. He hired a painter named Monetto in the year 1417 to paint an image on a tile of the most glorious Virgin Mary holding her Son in her arms. Mastro Baptist then lovingly laid the tile on an oak tree that stood at the edge of his vineyard, near the road leading to Bagnaia and along which robbers often awaited to attack unwary travelers.</p><p>The image remained there for about 50 years under cover of the oak's branches, and after a while only a few women who passed by ever stopped to say a prayer and to admire the beauty of a natural tabernacle that a wild vine, which had embraced the oak, had created.</p><p>During this period a hermit of Siena, Pier Domenico Alberti, whose hermitage was at the foot of Palanzana, went around the countryside and the nearby towns of Viterbo, saying, \"Among Bagnaia and Viterbo there is a treasure.\"</p><p>Many people, driven by greed, started digging there but found nothing and asked for an explanation from the hermit. Domenico then brought them under the oak tree chosen by the Virgin and pointed to the real treasure, the Madonna. He told them of the day he had decided to take away the sacred image to his hermitage, and of how it had returned to the oak.</p><p>Dominico was not alone in this experience. A devout woman named Bartolomea often walked past the oak tree and stopped each time to pray to the Blessed Virgin. One day she also decided to take the tile to her home. After saying her evening prayers, Bartolomea went to bed, but woke up in the morning to find the image missing. She at first thought that her family had taken it to place it somewhere else, but upon learning that this was not so, she ran to the oak tree and saw what he had already guessed: the tile had miraculously returned to its place amid the tendrils of the vine.</p><p>Bartolomea tried again, but always the sacred image returned to the tree. At first she did not say anything to anyone to avoid being taken for being mad.</p><p>Then, in 1467, during the month of August, the whole region was struck by the greatest scourge of those times: the plague. Everywhere there were the bodies of the dead lying in the deserted streets, and there was everywhere great weeping and mourning. Some then remembered the image painted on the humble tile, and, as if driven by an inexplicable force, went to kneel beneath the oak. Nicholas of Tuccia, an historian, said that on one day 30,000 people were there to beg for mercy.</p><p>A few days later the plague ceased, and then 40,000 of the faithful came back to thank the Virgin Mary. The people of Viterbo were headed by their bishop Pietro Gennari, and there were many from other regions.</p><p>In early September of the same year another extraordinary event happened.</p><p>A good knight of Viterbo had many enemies, as will often happen to a follower of Christ. One day he was surprised by his enemies outside the walls of Viterbo. Alone and unarmed, and having no way to deal with the mortal danger, he fled into the nearby woods. Fatigued and desperate to reach his destination, the knight heard the cries of the enemy draw nearer and nearer. Eventually he arrived at the oak with the sacred image of Mary, where he fell at her feet with great faith and embraced the trunk of the tree, putting his life into the hands of his Heavenly Mother.</p><p>The knight's enemies reached the oak, but were surprised that they could no longer see the knight. They began to look behind every tree and bush, but not one could see him since he had disappeared before their very eyes. Failing to find him after a long time spent in searching, they gave up in disgust.</p><p>Then the knight, after thanking the Virgin Mary, returned to Viterbo and told everyone what had happened. Bartolomea heard his tale, and encouraged by his words, she described the miracles to which she had been a witness. They told everyone what had happened to them with so much enthusiasm, faith that devotion that the stories spread like wildfire, and many people, coming from the most diverse regions of Italy, flocked to the feet of the oak to implore help from the Blessed Virgin.</p><p>It was decided to build an altar, and then a chapel of planks before Pope Paul II gave the necessary permission to build a small church in 1467. Many popes and saints have been devotees of the image, including St Charles Borromeo, St Paul of the Cross, St Ignatius Loyola, Saint Crispin of Viterbo, and St Maximilian Kolbe, among many others.</p><p>On January 20th, 1944, during the bombing of Viterbo, a squadron of 12 bombers headed for the oak, but upon arriving at their destination, inexplicably veered to the right and the bombs dropped did not destroying anything outside of  the asylum which was empty. The remains of the bombs, 3 large chunks, are kept behind the altar of the Madonna.</p><p>In 1986, Pope John Paul II proclaimed Our Lady of the Oak Patroness of the new diocese of Viterbo, formed from the union of those of Viterbo, Tuscania, Montefiascone, Acquapendente and Bagnoregio.</p><p>Even today the Virgin protects her devotees, and the devotion to the Blessed Virgin of the Oak is very strong.</p><p>Every year on the second Sunday of September, the faithful commemorate the \"Benefits from the Sacred Image of Our Lady of the Oak.\" Many cities and towns, with their brotherhoods, participate in the procession of thanksgiving, called the \"Covenant of Love \" The mayor of Viterbo, on behalf of all participants, renews the consecration made of old by the whole region back in 1467.</p>"

The uncle made inquiries, and found that there was indeed a wall there which had once formed part of a church. There was an attractive little tile on one side of it, showing the Madonna. He set about rebuilding the church.</p><p>Research revealed that the tile had been painted by a monk of Grotto Ferrata and that the church had been a pious venture of a good woman. There had been a dispute of the ownership of the land, and the church was abandoned. The years had converted the site into a wilderness again.</p><p>Santi's uncle with great perseverance and with the help of the Madonna, got the funds together and started rebuilding the church. Others helped, and in time a chapel was built to Our Lady of the Woods, and also a home for priests. Santi went there to live, so that he could serve Masses at the shrine.</p><p>By 1633, there were fifteen Masses said daily, and the pilgrims were coming in such droves to see Our Lady of the Woods that a fine new church had to be built.

It took much skill and prayer to move the picture without damage, but it was finally accomplished by a devout group of workmen, chanting litanies as they worked.</p><p>Plague and cholera both passed by Galloro when people prayed at the shrine of Our Lady.

It was during the time of the Hundred Years War in the year 1374, when John of Gaunt, the youngest son of King Edward III of England, decided to lead his army of 9,000 men from Calais to the relief of Aquitaine. Burning and pillaging as he went, he spread destruction and wreaked havoc in an effort to weaken the French, who nonetheless plagued him by setting ambushes along the way. When he came to Vassiviere he left only a fragment of the old church standing, through he left the statue of the Virgin untouched. It is not known why, other than perhaps that she inspired in him a certain respect, or through some unrecorded miracle.</p><p>John of Gaunt paid dearly for his raid, for one third of his army died in the fighting, while another third, including a larger number of horses, died from the cold weather, disease and starvation. The remnant of the army that reached Bordeaux on 24 December 1373 continued to succumb to the bubonic plague that was then raging in the city. The following year John of Gaunt left France and sailed for home in failure.</p><p>For over two-hundred years the statue of Our Lady of Vaussivieres remained standing in her niche amid the ruin of her chapel, which was now treated as if it were some type of roadside shrine frequented only by herdsmen and travelers. That all changed in the year 1547 when a merchant from Besse and two companions happened to pass by. The merchant was a Protestant, but one of the men with him was Catholic, and he stopped to kneel and pray before the statue of the Virgin, Protector of travelers. The merchant mocked the Catholic for his faith, refusing to recognize the majesty of the Queen of Heaven. He was immediately struck blind, causing him to soon repent of his error. When his sight did not return, he promised that he would become the Blessed Mother's most ardent devotee if she would only have mercy on him and return his sight to him. Our Lady restored his sight, and the merchant kept his promise, spreading the fame of Our Lady of Vaussivieres far and wide.</p><p>Soon there were many more miracles reported, and pilgrims began to congregate and kneel in great numbers amidst the ruins of the outdoor shrine frequented by cow herders. As there was a town in the valley with a church not too far away at Besse-en-Chandesse, it was decided that it would be a more fitting place for the pilgrims to go to venerate the statue of Our Lady. However, each time the statue was moved to Besse it would disappear, only to reappear in its niche in Vassiviere. This happened a total of three times before it was decided to build a new chapel in Vassivierre, where the statue would spend the warm summers, and then spend the rest of the year at the church in Besse-en-Chandesse. And so from July 2nd until the Sunday after the fall equinox the image of Notre-Dame de Vassiviere resides in her mountain hamlet, while the rest of the year she can be found in the church of Saint Andrew in Besse-en-Chandesse.</p><p>The people of Besse cut stones to rebuild the walls, assisted by the offerings of the pilgrims who had begun to come to the mountain to visit the statue of the virgin. The shrine they built was a small one, 24' by 48', made in the form of a cross. The statue of Our Lady of Vaussivieres was displayed behind a strong grate, surrounded by the candles and votive offerings brought to the shrine. By 1648 there had been 88 authentic miracles, including still-born babies being restored to life long enough to be baptized.</p><p>The original statue was destroyed during the Reign of Terror otherwise known as the French Revolution, but a copy was later made and solemnly crowned in 1881. This shrine, as well as many others, are centers of devout pilgrimages, and the miracles wrought by Our Lady in answer to the devout and earnest petitions of her clients are innumerable.</p><p>Apparently as one pilgrim remarked, \"Mary is a determined lady, and gets her way with her Divine Son,\" even to the place of residence, as her \"returns\" to Vaussivieres, above mentioned, prove.</p>"

It has a long and ancient history.</p><p>It was in about the year 330 when Saint Sanctinus, a disciple of Saint Denis, converted the city of Verdun to the True Faith, and later made it an Episcopal city when he became its first bishop. He built a church there in honor of Saints Peter and Paul.</p><p>In the year 457 Saint Pulchrone, whose name is often mistakenly spelled Polichraine, built the first church located at the site where Our Lady of Verdun is presently located. The fifth Bishop of Verdun, Saint Pulchrone, built the church inside the walls of the city on top of ancient Roman ruins. This church was actually named to honor Mary as Mother of God, a title that had recently been confirmed at the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon. It was at the council of Ephesus in 431 that Mary was formally affirmed to be Theotokos, \"God-bearer,\" or \"the one who gives birth to God.\" At Chalcedon, the nature of Christ was formally defined, teaching that He was God and man, \"one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, known in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.\" With this definition Mary was shown to be the Mother of God, and not just of Our Lord in his human nature. The church and Our Lady of Verdun was celebrated for numerous miracles.</p><p>In the year 990 Bishop Heimon built a new cathedral to Our Lady of Verdun, and in the 12th century a choir and two portals were added. In 997, the Emperor Otto III conferred on this Bishop Heimon, or Haymon, the title of count, making him and his successors Episcopal Counts.</p><p>The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene III in 1147. In the 14th century the flat wooden ceiling was replaced with a vaulted one, and side-chapels were added to the nave. Another side chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin in the Assumption was built in the 16th century. In 1755 the roof and towers were hit by lightning, which set them both on fire, which did significant damage to the church. The church was repaired and rebuilt in the Neo-Classical style in 1760.</p><p>The cathedral was once again severely damaged in World War I, as it was hit by artillery rounds in the Battle of Verdun which destroyed the towers. The crypt was rediscovered during the renovation that went on until the year 1936, and a re-inauguration took place in 1935. The millennial celebration of the cathedral took place in 1990.</p><p>The Arbennes family were the counts of Verdun, and Godfrey of Bouillon was a member of that family. Godfrey gave up his right to the count-ship before leaving on the First Crusade.</p>"

        "eng": "<p>In the year 1683 a formidable army of well over 100,000 Turks invaded Austria and laid siege to Vienna for the second time. The city was strategically located in Europe, and the Ottoman Turks had been pressing further and further into Christendom over the preceding centuries. If they could take Vienna, it would open up all of Europe to them.</p><p>Unfortunately, all of Europe was not united against the invader. The differing Protestant sects hated their Catholic neighbors more than they feared the Turk, and stood by doing nothing as the Catholics fought alone to save Europe. In fact, the Ottoman Empire had been supporting the Protestants, and encouraged them to revolt and rebel against their lawful government, which weakened Christendom and obviously played into the hands of the Turks. It went so far that they actually promised their Protestant dupes that they would be given the \"Kingdom of Vienna\" if they should help defeat them.</p><p>Suffering under an intense siege, Vienna was on the point of surrendering to the enemy. The people were filled with fear and anxiety, for had this happened, the Turks would easily have invaded the rest of Europe, and filled it with blood and strife. From all parts of the Catholic world prayers were offered to the Queen of Heaven, that she intercede and avert this disaster. Our Lady, Consoler of the Afflicted, did not fail her people.</p><p>The pious and valiant Catholic King of Poland, John Sobieski, with an army seemingly inadequate to the need, bravely marched against the enemy anyway. Even though his army was tiny in comparison to the multitudes that awaited him, there was no one else who could come to the aid of Vienna.</p><p>When John Sobieski came in sight of the Turkish camp, before beginning battle, he ordered Holy Mass to be celebrated, at which he himself served; then he begged the celebrant to bless the whole army.</p><p>Full of confidence in the help of Mary Most Holy, Our Lady of Victories, King John Sobieski manfully threw his forces into the conflict. Initiating what would be the largest cavalry charge in history, King John led his now legendary Winged Hussars into the face of the enemy like a host of avenging angels, disrupting the enemy formations and breaking their lines.</p><p>The enemy, though far more numerous, turned and fled, while the king's army were masters of the field. The rejoicing of Christians was great at this news, and from all Christendom fervent prayers were offered to the Blessed Mother, Our Lady of Victories, in thanksgiving for her protection.</p><p>Pope Innocent XI, reigning at the time, placed all his trust in the Blessed Virgin Mary. He had vowed to institute a feast in her honor, if she would liberate the Church from this terrible danger. In fulfillment of this vow, he extended to the whole Catholic world the solemnity of the feast of the Holy Name of Mary, which had up to that time only been observed in particular churches.</p><p>The famous image of Our Lady of Victories is the one which Emperor John Zimiarnes and John Commenus carried in a triumphal car after having besieged the enemy.

    "Our Lady of Victory Lepanto": {
        "eng": "<p>The Battle of Lepanto was a naval engagement that took place between the ships of the Catholic Holy League under Don Juan of Austria and the navy of the Ottoman Empire under Ali Pasha, supported by a large fleet of corsairs. The Ottoman Empire was far too powerful for any one Christian kingdom to stand against, and although all of Western Europe was threatened, only Spain, the Papal States, the Duchy of Savoy, the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, and the Knights of Saint John took a stand against them. Altogether they still had only 212 ships against no less than 278 ships.</p><p>For hundreds of years the Ottoman Empire had been making advances into Europe, while also making lightning raids along the coastlines to pillage and take slaves. They intended to eventually overwhelm all of Europe, and at that time Catholics stood almost alone against them as no Protestant force would do anything to oppose the invasion.</p><p>The advantage in this contest went strongly to the Turks, and so Pope Pius V implored all of Christendom to pray the Rosary to the Blessed Virgin Mary to obtain her intercession before the throne of God for their victory. Admiral Andrea Doria sailed to meet the Turks with an image of the Blessed Virgin prominently displayed in his flagship's state room.</p><p> The Venetian forces on Cyprus had been under siege by the Turks during the time that the Catholic forces were preparing to meet them. On August 1 they surrendered after being assured that they could leave the island unopposed. The Ottoman commander broke his solemn oath, however, taking the Venetians captive and flaying their captain while he was yet alive. Once he had completed this unspeakable torture, his dead body was hung from a spar on Mustafa's flagship alongside the heads of all the Venetian commanders. This was the type of barbarism the Catholic forces sailed to oppose.</p><p>The engagement took place on the 7th of October, 1571, only 6 years after the Knights of Saint John defeated a powerful Ottoman army at Malta. Don Juan of Austria encouraged his men by telling them that \"There is no paradise for cowards.\" If they should lose the engagement, the Mediterranean Sea would be opened up to assist future Ottoman invasions. Victory would mean at least a brief reprieve.</p><p>The Ottoman Turks had not lost any significant naval engagements in the memory of any living man, yet they were defeated. It was widely recognized that the battle was won through the power of Mary, Our Lady of Victory. TheTurks had come up like fire from the East, plundering, raping, enslaving, threatening to master the whole of Christendom, but had been defeated at Lepanto through the power of the Rosary.</p><p>The Turks had lost nearly 9 of every 10 ships, and 30,000 men went to a watery grave. The Holy League lost only 17 galleys and 7,500 men. Many historians rank Lepanto as the most decisive naval engagement since the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, proving to the Christians that the Turks could be beaten. Although the Turks soon rebuilt their fleet, many of their best soldiers and sailors were already dead at Malta and Lepanto.</p><p>This feast also celebrates another Christian victory, as in 1716, Mary, Queen of Victory, was chosen to protect her children again at Petenwardein. This battle was fought on August 5, 1716, between the Austrian army of Prince Eugene and the Turks at Peterwardein in Hungary, and it was also won through the power of Mary Most Holy.</p><p>To help equip the Christian army against the Turks, Pope Clement XI emptied the Papal treasury.</p><p>The two armies met on the morning of the feast of Our Lady of the Snows; the Christian army was outnumbered ten to three; the enemy had the advantage of position; but the Christian strength lay in the right of their cause and in Mary, who watched over them. The battle was long and hot, but, behind the lines in the churches of Europe, Catholics prayed: their prayers were heard. That evening the sun set on a free Hungary. Mary's men had won the day; Mary's banner floated victoriously over a Christian land.</p><p>The news filled the Christian world with joy, but nowhere more than at Rome. In thanksgiving to the Mother of God for her help, glorious, solemn, pontifical ceremonies of gratitude were held in the basilica of Saint Mary. After Lepanto, Pius V instituted the feast of the Holy Rosary in Rome, and Clement XI extended it to the world.</p><p>Today other more sinister errors eat at the heart of Christian culture: Naturalism undermining man's faith in God and himself. Communism is Mary's enemy; it transforms the state into a god to which men must be sacrificed. Men are children of God, sons of Mary, not slaves of the state.</p><p>Against the errors of our time, we must appeal to Mary; she is our guide, our Queen of Victories and of Peace. For her and for her blessed Son we struggle, and on her powerful intercession with the Prince of Peace we place our trust.</p><p>We struggle today to preserve our birthright as sons of God. Never in her history has America been so evidently on God's side. And Mary, our Mother, the Queen of Victory and of Peace, stands for our final victory, for our peace. Victory and peace must and will be ours, if we cling to the Mother of God. Mary will again crush the head of the Serpent, and this time, again, by means of her Rosary, if we have recourse to her through it.</p>"

All sorts of outrages were performed in it by the revolutionists. Afterwards it was used by a schismatic sect and later became a stock exchange. In 1809 it was restored to its original purpose but there were few parishioners left.</p><p>Father Charles Fritche des Gennettes was transferred to the church of Our Lady of Victories in 1832. He had been the pastor of Catherine Laboure. Father noticed that scarcely anyone came to Mass or received the sacraments. He tried all in his power, but to no avail, to bring the people back to the faith. Discouraged, he decided it was his duty as a failure to resign.</p><p>On Sunday, December 3, while saying Mass in an almost empty church, he, at the cannon of the Mass, cried out in distress. At that moment he heard a calm distinct voice say very solemnly:</p><p>\"Consecrate your parish to the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary.\"</p><p>After Mass he wondered whether he had imagined it; then again during his thanksgiving, he heard the same words. No longer doubting, he took a pen and composed the rules for the confraternity of Our Lady and received the Bishop's approval the same week.</p><p>The following Sunday, he told the ten people at Mass about his project and said there would be verspers of Our Lady that evening, and afterwards all details of the Confraternity of Our Lady would be given.</p><p>When Father Gennettes entered the church that evening, he found it filled for the first time in years; more than 400 people were there. The parish continued to flourish from then on. People came to the church from all other parts of Paris and France and finally, all parts of the world knew of the famous shrine, which now holds about 90,000 thank offerings for cures and favors.</p><p>In March 1855, a thanksgiving octave, for the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception was held. At the end of the octave, the statue was seen to move. This happened again and Pope Pius IX took this as a sign of thanks for his act, and ordered the statue to be crowned June 1850. Saint Therese of the Child Jesus was cured through the intercession of Our Lady of Victories.</p><p>The Miraculous Medal which Our Lady gave us in 1830 shows the Sacred Heart of Jesus with the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

In 1620 the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand II and Prince Maxmilian of Bavaria gained a major victory over a coalition of Protestant armies in the battle of the White Mountains near Prague. The previous day, Rev Fr Dominic of Jesus-Maria, a discalced Carmelite, had found in the castle of Strakowicz a picture representing the nativity of Christ. It showed the Blessed Virgin kneeling before her Divine Son, while St Joseph stood behind her holding a lantern. In the background were two shepherds. The Calvanists had shown their fanaticism by piercing the eyes of Mary and her spouse, St Joseph.</p><p>Carrying the picture to the camp, the monk held it up and urged the soldiers to restore Mary's honor. His words decided the hesitation of the generals and gave courage to the men. They adopted Mary's name as their battle cry and Mary blessed their efforts. In the moment of success, they hailed the painting as Our Lady of Victory and carried it in triumph into Prague, where their leaders adorned it with rich jewels.</p><p>In gratitude to God for his great success, and in recognition of the help given by Father Dominic, Ferdinand II founded several Carmelite monasteries, including one at Prage which was solemnly blessed under invocation of Our Lady of Victory.</p><p>Before this time, however, Father Dominic had taken the picture of Our Lady of Victory to Rome where it was first venerated in the Basilica of St. Mary Major, then carried  -  in the presence of Pope Gregory XV  -  to the church of St Paul near the Carmelite convent, on May 8, 1622. Pope Paul V subsequently changed the name of the church to Our Lady of Victory, and the feast was officially inaugurated.</p><p>The original painting was destroyed in a fire in 1833 and has been replaced by a copy.

Easily one of the most significant battles to take place in the Middle Ages, there were combatants from several European countries taking part on one side or the other.</p><p>With the death of King Richard the Lion-hearted, his brother John claimed the lands of Normandy along with England, even though he had no right to them, as they rightfully belonged to his nephew, a boy named Arthur. John probably killed Arthur, as he was the one with the most to gain. When King Philip Augustus heard that John was claiming to be the Duke of Normandy, he called him to account for his nephew. When John refused, King Philip took away his right to rule Normandy. Rather than submit, John joined forces with the German Emperor and the Count of Flanders in open rebellion.</p><p>King Philip went to Mass with his troops just prior to the battle. His army probably numbered in total about 15,000 men, while the allied forces arrayed against him were nearly double that size. Knowing that his noblemen were anxious about the upcoming battle, King Philip took off his crown and placed it upon the altar, saying: \"If anyone here thinks he can wear this crown more worthily than I, let him step forward to take it.\" Philip's men loudly reaffirmed their faith in their king and went enthusiastically to the battle.</p><p>The battle was hotly contested, and both King Philip and Otto IV of Germany had several horses killed beneath them. At one point when King Philip was unhorsed he was surrounded by Flemish pikemen. It is related that his life was only saved due to the superior plate mail armor he wore, but later events came to demonstrate that it was also because of the intervention of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p><p>King Philip captured the Count of Flanders and took him back to France to display him to his nobles like a pet in an iron cage. The victory did much more than bring an end to the king of England's claims to Brittany and Normandy, it also helped strengthen the monarchy in France as it simultaneously weakened the monarchy in England. When King John returned to England, his position was so weakened that he felt compelled to sign the Magna Carta, which greatly limited his power over his subjects. Otto IV of Germany was deposed soon after he returned to his own realm.</p><p>In thanksgiving for his victory, King Philip Augustus founded the Abbey of Victory between Senlis and the Bishop Mount, to honor the Mother of God for this signal victory.</p>"

This feast day was mistakenly given in the text with the date of 1202, when it actually occurred in the year 1212. King Alfonso IX of Leon is also often cited, although it was actually his cousin, King Alfonso VIII of Castile, who carried this miraculous flag upon which there was a picture of Our Lady. There are many military historians who view this battle as one of the 50 most important battles in the history of the world.</p><p>At the battle of Las Navas the courageous King Alfonso VIII, King of Castile, faced a huge army of one quarter of a million Almohad warriors who had invaded Spain from Africa. Knights from all parts of Europe gathered in Toledo in response to Pope Innocent's proclamation of a new crusade. Ten thousand knights and 100,000 foot soldiers, they were far more men than the city could ever hope to contain, and so they set up their colorful tents all about the city. It was the most powerful Christian army ever assembled during the whole of the Reconquest up until that time, yet it paled in comparison to the Islamic host they sought to engage.</p><p>On the day of battle, the Almohad army had drawn up at Las Navas in a massive square. They faced the Christians behind a front rank wielding long spears to keep the cavalry from breaking their line. The second rank carried both spears and javelins to support the front line while still being capable of attacking with the longer ranged weapon. Next came the slingers to hurl stones at the armored knights, and finally came archers, protected by all the ranks that stood before them. Their leader, Miramamolin, had boasted that \"he was strong enough to fight against all who adored the sign of the cross.\"</p><p>King Alfonso remained with his reserves, and with him were the knights of the military orders. The valor of these knights was legendary, for they were skilled fighters who engaged the enemy caring little whether they lived or died. Their concern was only for the salvation of their souls, the honor of Christendom, and the greater glory of God. Above their heads floated the royal banner of Castile, and upon it an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary holding her infant Son in her lap. The banner had been given to King Alfonso after an apparition in which Our Lady had appeared to a sacristan at the Marian shrine of Rocamadour, ordering him to deliver the banner to the Castilian king. The sacristan had done so joyfully, and now that banner was held aloft near another banner depicting Christ's Holy Cross.</p><p>The battle began to the sound of trumpets as the two forces rushed together, and the floor of the valley shuddered at the tremendous impact. The fighting was fierce, and it seemed the Christians would lose the battle when King Alfonso plowed into the fray with his reserves. It was at that moment that a great miracle occurred.</p><p>The king's banners floated above the tempest that was but a churning sea of bodies, blades and bobbing helmets where King Alfonso had briefly cleared his way with deadly blows. No man bore either banner, for they were both now held in the invisible hands of angels. The banners moved, seemingly of their own accord, passing directly over the heads of the astounded enemy. They finally came to rest motionless in the air above Miramamolin's own tent. The Africans fired arrows and threw stones at the banners, but try as they might, they could do nothing to harm the banners. Mary, Virgin Most Powerful, had claimed that camp, and there was nothing anyone could do to change it.</p><p>A wail of despair rose to the skies, while desert warriors scattered and leapt aside. King Alfonso had seemingly come from nowhere to burst upon the very point on which the whole battle turned. The valorous king was prepared to die rather than be conquered, as his smoldering eyes gave evidence. It seemed to the Moors that an avenging angel had sped down to earth from the heavens, and like men gone mad with terror, they cast down their spears and began to flee in all directions, running wildly into each other.</p><p>King Alfonso had fearlessly led his Christian army to an incredible, even miraculous, victory. Later that night the Sierras resounded, shaken by that hymn of thanksgiving raised up by the Church of Spain to the God of Battles.</p>"

The loss of the French fleet meant that the war between France and England would take place on French soil.</p><p>After his victory at Sluys, King Edward III landed with his army and began the siege of Tourney, or Tournai, on July 23rd. (Tournai was a Flemish city, but it was loyal to the French king and housed a garrison of French troops.) Edward had 1,300 men-at-arms and 3,000 archers, as well as 5,455 infantry reinforced by perhaps 1,000 Flemish men-at-arms. He had every advantage, as his army was larger than that of Philip VI of France, he had a good supply line, and rather than reject his presence, many of the Flemish were his allies, and the morale of his army was good.</p><p>Philip VI of France remained many miles away from Edward with his army, so Edward sent him a challenge in which he claimed to be the rightful king of France. \"Such a great force of men as we have assembled cannot long hold together, without causing harm and destruction to the people and to the land, something which every good Christian should eschew, and especially princes and others who hold themselves for governors of men; therefore we greatly desire that the matter be concluded soon, and that, to avoid the death of Christians, as the quarrel is between you and us, that the debate of our challenge be conducted by our two bodies.\"</p><p>Philip declined the offer, as Edward was a younger and more vigorous man. The English besiegers cut off the town from any supplies of food, defeated any who sallied forth from the town to attempt to break the siege, and bombarded Tournai with siege engines and canon fire. The lands all around were ravaged and burned.</p><p>The siege had gone on only one month when the inhabitants were running out of food and beginning to starve. The inhabitants carried the keys of the city into the church of Our Lady, for they knew that the Queen of heaven alone was able to deliver them from the English, who had besieged them for forty days. No sooner had they testified this confidence in the Blessed Virgin, than the siege was raised, and it came about in this way.</p><p>Jeanne of Valois, the sister of Philip and mother-in-law of Edward, left the convent for the purpose of trying to make peace between the two. She went first to Philip, who refused to negotiate for fear of losing face. These were his lands that were being invaded, and it would not do that he should seem unwilling to defend them.</p><p>Jeanne went next to Edward, who felt certain that Tournai was about to collapse.

Philip of Valois, or King Philip VI, \"Philip the Fortunate,\" was the King of France beginning that year until his death in 1350. </p><p>Philip was nearly forced to lead his army against the band of Flemish rebels under Nicolas Zannekin, who were seeking independence from French rule. Having refused to pay what they considered to be excessive taxes to the Count of Flanders, they eventually imprisoned the king's representative and captured several French towns. The Pope asked Philip to do what he could with the rebels, but after having restored the Flemish aristocracy, the Flemish rebels had turned even on them, killing many of them.</p><p>Philip was certain of victory, taking 2,500 knights and 12,000 infantry and archers with him into battle. Not knowing where he would attack, the Flemish rebels would have to divide their forces to protect their territory. Even so, the Flemish under Zannekin brought 15,000 soldiers into the field at Cassel.</p><p>For three days the two armies did nothing but taunt each other, though the Flemish commenced a direct attack on the French on the third day. Apparently the French were caught off guard, for many of them had taken off their armor because of the extreme heat that day. Fleeing in panic, the knights left the field while much of the French nobility who stood their ground were wounded. The Duke of Lorraine was slain, and the situation appeared desperate.</p><p>It is recorded that Philip of Valois, being surrounded by Flemish soldiers as the flower of his nobility fell, had recourse to the Blessed Virgin, who immediately delivered him from that danger.

It is now protected because of its historical importance, and for no other reason.</p><p>According to tradition, the origin of the Church of Our Lady of Virtues relates to the appearance of Our Lady to a keeper of cows back in the early fifteenth century. The apparition gave rise to a pilgrimage to the site, as well as the later construction of a primitive chapel, presumably made of wood and other perishable materials. A short time later, due to the growing importance of the site and the devotion of the faithful that he saw going on around him, King Duarte commanded that a Franciscan monastery be built that would be attached to the chapel. Following upon the construction of the monastery, a hospital was also soon built, and then subsequently inns and other businesses supporting the thriving community that grew up around the chapel. Pilgrimages to the shrine became widespread throughout the remainder of the fifteenth century.</p><p>Of unquestionable importance throughout the Middle Ages, the more recent centuries have seen the abandonment of pilgrimages to the shrine, as well as the decay of the buildings and the eventual abandonment of the site by the Franciscans. At the beginning of the 1990's, when excavations were made at the monastery, all that remained was ruins. Despite the fact that the monastery was almost completely destroyed, there are still some structural remains located on the north side of the church, and most of these structures are assumed to still be buried beneath the earth. This is believed because the church of Our Lady of Virtues itself was partially buried before the archaeological work was begun to reveal it.</p>"

The pastor immediately placed the statue that had just been discovered in the church later that same day.</p><p>The next morning when the priest returned to the church, he found that the statue was missing. After much inquiry and searching for the statue, the farmer found the statue was once again in his field. The man returned the statue to the church, but once again it disappeared from its place, only to be found again in the field. This occurred a total of three times before it was decided to build a shrine in the field where the statue had first been found. The strange phenomenon brought people from near and far to the shrine. Soon the image proved to be miraculous and pilgrimages were formed. The church which was built to honor the image of Our Lady was given to the Carmelite Order.</p>"

In that year a Catholic noblewoman, Richeldis de Faverches, had prayed to the Blessed Virgin for the favor of knowing what she might do to honor her. The Blessed Virgin appeared to the noblewoman in vision, showing her the Holy House where the Annunciation had taken place, and according to some traditions, the replica was miraculously completed in Walsingham as Richeldis de Faverches prayed. It soon became a popular place of pilgrimage, and the Augustinian canons were granted papal approval to build a priory in 1150.</p><p>This was England during the reign of the pious king Saint Edward the Confessor. A long list of succeeding kings and queens made pilgrimages to the shrine during the following centuries, including the daughter of Queen Isabella of Spain and wife of King Henry VIII, Catherine of Aragon. It is even said that Anne Boleyn may have once had the intention of visiting the shrine during an unaccustomed moment of piety.</p><p>The royal patronage, along with the gifts of pious Catholics, enriched the shrine, so much so that by the year 1346 the priory gates had to be kept locked at night due to the great value of the jewels and other offerings at the shrine. When Erasmus visited the shrine, he noted that it was surrounded on all sides with gems, gold and silver. The shrine of Walsingham was by now one of the most prominent religious centers in all of England, especially during times of war or plague when travel to Rome and the shrine of Santiago de Compestella were more difficult than usual.</p><p>During the \"Reformation,\" King Henry VIII showed his true intention by stealing all of the offerings of gold, silver, and precious jewels at the shrine. When a group of Catholic men protested that this was no \"Reformation,\" but burglary, they were all hanged, beheaded and quartered by a man who would be god, pretending to have virtuous motives for starting a new sect. In the year 1538, the monastery was suppressed and the famous statue of Our Lady of Walsingham was taken to London and burnt. Little more than an arch remains today of that original shrine, although the site is marked on the lawn in the place where it once stood.</p><p>In a time when it was a crime to be Catholic in England, nothing remained of the shrine of Walsingham but the memory of the glory that once was. It wasn't until the year 1829 when the Catholic Emancipation was finally declared and public expressions of Catholic faith were once again tolerated.</p><p>In 1896, a woman named Charlotte Boyd restored the Slipper Chapel, which was once a wayside chapel for pilgrims en-route to the shrine of Walsingham. A copy of the Holy House was built there the next year, and in 1897 Pope Leo XIII declared it the new National Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham. Visits to the shrine increased since that time, and a copy of the original statue was reproduced based on the seal of the ancient shrine.</p>"

        "eng": "<p>Today the village of Zapopan is a quiet little place not many miles from Guadalajara by an excellent highway. Its tranquility and religious atmosphere must be a far cry from pre-Conquest times, when it was a feudal district and tributary of the powerful King of Tonala. In those days the Indians of the district worshiped an idol called Teopintzintl, \"The Child God,\" to which they offered gifts of hare and partridge. When the kingdom of Tonala bowed to Nuno de Guzman in 1530, Zapopan came under Spanish dominion. The Indian queen, Chihuapili Tzapotzinco, ordered all the chieftains under her rule to render their obedience to the Spanish Crown, and in March of 1530 the cacique of Atemajac, under whose jurisdiction lay Zapopan, complied with this order. The Mixton War of 1541, however, depopulated the district, and the encomendero of Tlaltenango, Francisco de Bobadilla, obtained the Viceroy's permission to repopulate Zapopan with Indians from Tlaltenango, thus lessening the chance of another uprising.</p><p>On the eigth of December, 1541, the pueblo of Zapopan was resettled in accordance with the agreement, and on that day the Franciscan Fray Antonio de Segovia gave to the newly settled colony a small image of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. For ten years it had accompanied him on his apostolic journeys. In fact, only a short while before, while the Mixton War was still in progress, Fray Antonio, with his missionary companion Fray Miguel de Bolonia, had gone among the warring Indians, the image about his neck, exhorting them to make peace with the Spaniards. It is related that while Fray Antonio was preaching, the Indians saw luminous rays issuing from the image of Our Lady, and that this fact, as much as his preaching, caused them to stop fighting. In thirty-six hours Fray Antonio de Segovia brought to the Viceroy for pardon more than six thousand Indians, who had laid down their arms. From that time Fray Antonio called the image La Pacificadora, \"She Who Makes Peace.\"</p><p>The image is made of pasta de Michoacan  -  pieces of cornstalk smoothed and cemented together by glue. It is little more than thirteen inches in height, and represents the Virgin Mary under her title of the Immaculate Conception. The hands, joined before the breast, are of wood. The original sculpture donated by Fray Antonio de Segovia consisted only of the upper half, it is believed, the lower section having been added at a later date. As the lower half is not in proportion to the upper, the reconstruction gives a stunted effect to the image. However, since the original sculptured garments nowadays are always covered with rich vestments of fabric, the disproportion is not apparent.</p><p> sculptured form, the statue represents Our Lady standing with her feet upon a rudely formed crescent moon. She wears a red tunic and a dark blue mantle outlined in gold. The eyes are painted, and the somewhat thick lips are closed. One may find much to be desired in the image, considered as a work of art. Yet we must remember that it has the honor of being the first image of the Virgin Mary venerated in the State of Jalisco, and that it has seen the Church in that part of Mexico grow from the tiniest seed to the great, many-branched tree of the present-day Catholic Faith. Furthermore, for over four centuries, Our Lady of Zapopan has been a constant channel of heavenly favors to the people of Jalisco.</p><p>It was Diego de Herrera, pastor of Zapopan from 1637, who first learned of the special regard in which the natives of Zapopan held the image. In 1653, after careful investigation of the facts, the Bishop of Guadalajara, Don Juan Ruiz Colmenero, issued a decretal declaring the image \"miraculous\" and appointing the eighteenth of December as the annual celebration of the Feast of Our Lady of the Expectation of Zapopan. Under this title the image is still venerated today.</p><p>There are other titles of Our Lady of Zapopan for which she is justly celebrated. These are: Patroness of Guadalajara, General of the Armies, and Queen of Jalisco. Each of the three has its proper history.</p><p>The end of the seventeenth century saw Guadalajara scourged by a terrible epidemic. The Bishop ordered the statue of Our Lady of Zapopan to be carried in procession from its temple into the cathedral of Guadalajara. There is in the ecclesiastical archives a sworn testimonial from the medical profession in Guadalajara, certifying that, following this procession, the plague ceased at once. In 1721, with the onslaught of another plague, Our Lady's image was again brought to Guadalajara and carried from one barrio to another, again effecting a cessation of the plague. Our Lady was also invoked for protection against the violent storms and lightning which threaten Guadalajara during the rainy season.</p><p>For these and other reasons Our Lady of Zapopan was officially declared Patroness of Guadalajara specifically \"against storms, lightning, and epidemics.\" Accordingly, each year from 1734 up to the present day, Our Lady of Zapopan leaves her sanctuary on the thirteenth of June and all through the rainy season, until the fourth of October, visits the churches in every barrio of Guadalajara.</p><p>In 1821, the \"Year of Independence,\" the achievement of independence took place on the thirteenth of June, at the time Our Lady's image was entering Guadalajara for her annual pilgrimage. Accordingly the government of Jalisco decided to commission Our Lady of Zapopan \"General of the Army of the State.\" On the fifteenth of September in that year, in the presence of the officials of both Church and State, the venerable image was vested in the blue shoulder sash and gold baston of a general. In 1852, while Guadalajara was in a state of siege, with the water supply og the city cut off, General Blancarte placed a new sash of rank on Our Lady of Zapopan and had a twenty-one-gun salute fired in her honor, reinvoking her as Patroness and General of the army of Jalisco. Once again the Virgin effectively protected her city. In 1894 the Governor of Jalisco made a similar proclamation, and bestowed a new sash upon the image.</p><p>In the year 1919 Our Lady of Zapopan received a new honor, this time from the Vatican. On the seventeenth of June in that year, the Vatican Chapter decreed the canonical Coronation of Our Lady of Zapopan. The sacred image was solemnly invested with a golden crown in the cathedral of Guadalajara.</p>"

As he was passing through a forest looking for a suitable place for his hermitage, he encountered a massive, black boulder that blocked his way. Magnus was stymied, as he could not continue in that direction, and so he took out a small statue of the Blessed Virgin that he kept with him. Placing the statue on a log, he knelt down to pray for guidance.</p><p>The heavenly assistance he requested was not long in coming, for the ground began to tremble, and with a loud crack, the boulder broke in two. A strange light emanated from the broken edges of the stone, revealing the miraculous cause of the break. Magnus realized at once that he had found the location of the hermitage he had been seeking, and placed his cherished statue on a stump and built a small shrine to display the miraculous statue.

It is just over 18 inches tall, and is kept in what is called the Chapel of Miracles, which is located above the very place where Magnus had made his monastic cell. The statue depicts the Mother of God holding the Divine Child in her arm. The baby Jesus holds an apple, recalling the fall of man and his later redemption. The statue is also known as the Great Mother of Austria, the Great Lady of Hungary, and the Great Mother of the Slavic People.</p><p>This first small shrine was enlarged with a church in the year 1200, and was further expanded in 1335 after King Henry I had been granted a miraculous cure after being told in a dream to go to Our Lady of Zell. King Louis the Great of Hungary had the Mariazell Basilica built in the year 1363, which is also known as the Basilica of the Birth of the Virgin Mary, in gratitude for a military victory he won over a numerically superior army of Turks: 20,000 men against 80,000 Turks. The church he had built was of Gothic style, and in 1377, King Louis I added a chapel called the Gnadenkappelle, the Chapel of Grace. The church was damaged by fire in 1420 and again in 1474, but then expanded again in the 17th century, and is the same church that stands today.</p><p>The various peoples of the broad Danubian area have made Our Lady of Zell the goal of their pilgrimages.

In art, the Blessed Mother is represented under these titles as holding both a dove and an olive branch  -  recognized symbols of peace.</p><p>Several stories accompany these titles. In one account from South America, tradition maintains that in 1682, several merchants found a heavy, abandoned box on the shore of El Salvador's \"Mar de Sur\", which they were unable to open. Believing it to contain a treasure of great value, they carried it to the city of San Miguel to find a way to unlock it. They tied it onto the back of a donkey, intending to bring it to the local civil authorities, but as they passed the parish church, the donkey stopped and lay on the ground, refusing to move. In front of the church, they were suddenly able to open the box, which contained an image of the Blessed Mother holding the Christ Child. At that time, a bloody war raged in the local region, but when the warring parties heard of the abandoned box, they immediately put down their weapons and discontinued the fighting. Because of this incident (and others that followed to maintain the peace), this image of Mary was given the title \"Our Lady of Peace\". Pope Benedict XV authorized the crowning of this image on November 21, 1921.</p><p>Our Lady Queen of Peace also has roots in Europe.

The church required throughout columns whose appearance would not fall short of the beauty of the building and of such a size that they could resist the weight of the load which would rest upon them. However, the site itself, being very far from the sea inland and walled about on all sides by hills that were quite steep, made it impossible for those who were preparing the foundations to bring columns from outside.</p><p>But when the impossibility of this task was causing the Emperor to become impatient, God revealed a natural supply of stone perfectly suited to this purpose in the nearby hills, one which had either lain there in concealment previously, or was created at that moment. Either explanation is credible to those who trace the cause of it to God; for while we, in estimating all things by the scale of man's power, consider many things to be wholly impossible, for God nothing in the whole world can be difficult or impossible. So the church is supported on all sides by a number of huge columns from that place, which in color resemble flames of fire, some standing below and some above and others in the stoas which surround the whole church except on the side facing the east.</p><p>Two of these columns stand before the door of the church, exceptionally large and probably second to no column in the whole world. Here is added another colonnaded stoa which is called the narthex, I suppose because it is not broad. Beyond this is a court with similar columns standing on the four sides. From this there lead doors to the interior which are so stately that they proclaim to those walking outside what kind of sight they will meet within. Beyond there is a wonderful gateway and an arch, carried on two columns, which rises to a very great height. Then as one advances there are two semi-circles which stand facing each other on one side of the road which leads to the church, while facing each other on the other side are two hospices, built by the Emperor Justinian.

We see every day how like people get to each other who live with those they love. When they live with those whom they don't love, as, for instance, the members of a family who quarrel with each other, then the longer they live together the more unlike each other they become; but when they love each other, as husband and wife, parents and children, brothers with brothers or sisters, friends with friends, then in course of time they get surprisingly like each other. All of us perceive this; we are witnesses to it with our own eyes and ears - in the expression of their features, in their voice, in their walk, in their language, even in their handwriting, they become like each other; and so with regard to their minds, as in their opinions, their tastes, their pursuits. And again doubtless in the state of their souls, which we do not see, whether for good or for bad.</p><p>Now, consider that Mary loved her Divine Son with an unutterable love; and consider too she had Him all to herself for thirty years. Do we not see that, as she was full of grace before she conceived Him in her womb, she must have had a vast incomprehensible sanctity when she had lived close to God for thirty years? - a sanctity of an angelical order, reflecting back the attributes of God with a fulness and exactness of which no saint upon earth, or hermit, or holy virgin, can even remind us. Truly then she is the Mirror of Divine Perfection.</p>"

    "The Monastery of Bethune": {
        "eng": "<p>B\u00e9thune is an appealing city located in Artois, the famous name of the former province that was renowned in the Middle Ages for its production of cloth. It is situated between Arras and Saint Omer, about 45 miles south-east of the city of Calais, and about 116 miles north of Paris.</p><p>There appears to be only one church in Bethune, and that is the church of Saint Vaast, which dates only from the 1920's. According to tradition, the first church was built by the bishop of Arras, Saint Vaast, near the confluence of the two rivers nearby, at a place once called Catorive, in about the year 502. This church was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p><p>The first church dedicated to Saint Vaast was built by the Emperor, and dates from 1533. That church was destroyed, along with nearly all the town, during German bombing in 1918. The land around Bethune and the surrounding villages was the scene of intense battles during World War I, so that the entire region had to be rebuilt after the war. The church was quickly rebuilt in the Roman-Byzantine style, but the bombing and warfare probably account for the fact that there does not seem to be any current record of a monastery of Bethune.</p><p>The city's main architectural attraction is its belfry, which is a kind of symbol or emblem of the city. The first belfry was made only of wood in 1346, and was used as a watch tower with one alarm ball, but then was rebuilt using sandstone in 1388. It was made taller in 1437, and was once above the entrance to the 'Cloth Hall.' When the building behind it burned down in 1664, only the isolated belfry remained standing. The belfry now has 35 bells.</p><p>There is also a famous Monastic Breviary and Missal known as the Bethune Breviary. It is an early 14th century parchment prayer book once used by the monks for prayer. It is unusual in that it includes the canon of the Mass. It is also highly illustrated, and was probably once used at the monastery of the Annunciation that no longer exists in Bethune, France.</p>"

    "Morning Star": {
        "eng": "<p>There is no title in all the Litany more descriptive of Mary's loving office to men than \"Morning Star.\" Every star, indeed, is an image of Her. Her most popular figure is \"Star of the Sea,\" due no doubt to the loveliest of Her hymns - the Ave Maris Stella, which goes back at least to the ninth century, and to the Alma Redemptoris Mater, of the eleventh century.</p><p>Mary had much to do with stars. The Star of Bethlehem was the only lamp for the cave. \"We have seen His star in the East,\" said the Mary, and they found it again reflected in the eyes of Mary.</p><p>There is a lovely legend about an old well in the Holy Land, called \"Mary's well.\" The story is that once when the Holy Family was going from Bethlehem to Jerusalem they rested by that well and drank of its waters. When the Wise Men were on their way to Bethlehem, they lost the star for a while, but they found it again shining in the waters of Mary's well.</p><p>The \"Morning Star\" has always had a special application to Mary. The Church interprets the verse in the Canticle of Canticles (vi, 9) as descriptive of Her. \"Who is She that cometh forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun?\" Every church today, as in ages past, has its altar of the Blessed Virgin. In the old Cathedrals, the Lady Chapel was situated behind the choir and the high altar, and to the extreme east, as the symbol of Her as the Morning Star. We read in an old book of the 16th century: \"Like as the morning cometh before the sun rising, and divideth the night from the day, so the Virgin Mary rose as the morning before the Sun of Justice, and divided the state of grace from the state of sin, the children of God from the children of darkness. Whereupon the Church singeth to Her praise that Her glorious life gave light to the world and illumined all the Church and congregations of faithful people.\" So a Solemn Mass was sung every day at early dawn in Her honor, and the bell for rising was called \"Saint Mary's bell.\" St. Bridget of Sweden calls Her \"the star preceding the sun.\"</p><p>The Hymn for the Feast of Our Lady's Apparition at Lourdes, has this stanza: \"O dawn that goeth before the sun, joyous herald of our salvation, thy people, O Virgin, suppliantly invoke Thee amid the shades of night.\" Dante must have been thinking of Her when he wrote, as coming out of the Inferno: \"Thence issuing we again beheld the stars;\" and surely of Her when he wrote: \"Of tremulous luster like the Matin star,\" and \"Pure and made apt for mounting to the stars.\" To him the Inferno was \"the air pierced by no star.\" St. John in the Apocalypse tells of the Woman Clothed with the Sun: \"On Her head was a crown of twelve stars.\" So in art Our Lady is often picture as the Madonna of the Star. Stars are embroidered on Her veil or on the right shoulder of Her blue mantle. Art glorifies Her as the Morning Star, the Star of the Sea, the Star of Jacob, the Fixed Star.</p><p>The very thought of Light brings up the vision of Mary, so much had She to do with the Light of the world. Her arms were the candlestick for that Light. Candlemas, the Feast of Lights, is Her Feast, as She holds up to a darkened world the true Light. So, St. Epiphanius (\u2020 403) called Her \"Mother of Eternal Light.\" In the Hymn for the Feast of the Guardian Angels She is also called \"Mother of Light,\" and in the Hymn for the Feast of the Most Holy Rosary: \"Twelve stars now crown the brow of the glorious Mother; near the throne of Her Son She reigns over all created things.\"</p><p>Our Lady of PontmainAn old woman who saw the Little Flower when she was dead, said that her feet looked \"as if they had walked on light.\" A convert in India who had a vision of Our Lady was asked what She looked like. He answered, \"She was composed of light, She was all light.\" Even when little Bernadette had her visions of Our Lady and went into ecstasy at the sight, the onlookers said they could never forget the child's face, it was so full of beauty and light, as if it were the reflection from the light of the Mother of God. Our Lady of Hope appeared to some children at Pontmain, France. They described Her as surrounded by stars. \"Oh, there are so many stars the Blessed Virgin will soon be gilt all over.\"</p><p>Yes, as the Hymn Quem terra sings - She is the \"refulgent hall of Light.\" She is also called \"Light of the Despairing,\" \"Daughter of the Light Unapproachable,\" \"Our Light,\" \"Bright Moon of Purity,\" \"Brilliant Star of Purity,\" \"Rising Moon of Purity,\" \"Sun without a Stain,\" \"Living Light of Holiness.\"</p><p>\"Our Lady of Light\" was an old title of Hers in the Middle Ages. It is said that She Herself suggested that title to St. Thomas of Canterbury. There was a Confraternity of Our Lady of Light, and St. Francis Xavier and his companions were enrolled in it before they set out for the Indies. The Confraternity of Our Lady of Light, Spouse of the Holy Ghost was founded in England, in 1824. Pope Leo XIII indulgenced this prayer: \"Our Lady of Light, Spouse of the Holy Ghost, I give Thee my whole self, soul and body, all I have or may have, to keep for Jesus that I may be His forever more. Our Lady of Light, Spouse of the Holy Ghost, pray for me.\"</p><p>But the most common \"Star\" figure, which all the spiritual writers have used, is \"Star of the Sea,\" the guide to man who is sailing on the sea of life. St. Bernard, as many others, interpreted Miriam (Hebrew for \"Mary\") as meaning Star of the Sea, and thus explains it: \"Because without loss of its own integrity, a star sends forth its rays - and so Mary brought forth Jesus. She is, therefore, that noble star risen out of Jacob, whose ray illuminates the whole earth, whose splendor both shines above and pierces the nether darkness, enlightening the earth and giving heat rather to souls than to bodies, nourishing virtues, expelling vices. Mary is the excellent, bright and wonderful Star lifted up necessarily above this great and wide ocean, shining with merits, illuminating with example. Behold the Star!\"</p><p>It is a strange thing, but almost all the figures of speech in Scripture about the sea refer to its power and its dangers. All dreaded the unknown sea. Having no compass in those days, many ships were lost in the great traffic on the Mediterranean. The sea has always had its dangers. The sailors knew that better than anyone else. A strange name the Eastern sailors gave Her - Mother of Tears, evidently because the sea made so many mothers weep for their lost sailor boys. But the Catholic sailor was devoted to the Star of the Sea. He needed Her protection in his dangerous calling, so he called his boat after one of Her titles, paid his homage to Her shrines along the coast, made vows of pilgrimage and of offering to Her. One of the most famous shrines of France is that of Our Lady of Mariners, at Marseilles. At the end of the 12th century a fisherman of Marseilles was overtaken in his boat by a violent storm. He raised his eyes to the rock of the Garde. He beheld a figure there. He sang the Ave Maris Stella. Somehow he got to land. Many sailors saw that same apparition on the rock. A chapel was erected and a statue was placed there, called \"Our Lady of Help\" or \"Help of Mariners.\" Since then She is honored as the Protectress of Marseilles. Many stories are told of sailors in distress seeing Our Lady at the wheel guiding their boat through the storm. She was, indeed, \"the Star above the storms.\"</p>"

    "Mother Most Amiable": {
        "eng": "<p>One of the Marian titles that we find in the Litany of the Virgin Mary is \"Virgin most amiable\". Mary is amiable because her heart is virginal, pure, and able to give and receive love. Purity and intimacy are intertwined. For this reason we can look with admiration upon the relationship between Mary and Joseph. For many centuries Joseph was represented in the arts as an old man, so as to \"safeguard\" Mary's virginity. Pope John Paul II, in his general audience on August 21st, 1996 said that \"we can suggest that Joseph was not an old man when he married Mary. His interior perfection, the result of God's grace, brought him to live his spousal relationship with Mary with a virginal affection\".</p><p>Mary's question to the angel Gabriel \"how is it possible, since I do not know man?\" can only be understood in light of her decision to live as a virgin. Upon discovering that Mary is pregnant, Josephdecides to \"divorce her quietly.\" The traditional Hebrew marriage was celebrated in two different moments. The first phase consisted of a wedding contract; the second took place when the bride and the groom would begin their life together. When the Archangel Gabriel announced the birth of Jesus, Mary and Joseph were therefore not simply engaged to each other, but they were already married, though they had not yet moved to live in the same house.</p><p>A famous theologian, Ignace de la Potterie, suggests that Joseph wanted to divorce Mary quietly not because he doubted her innocence; rather because he recognized God's work in her and did not feel worthy to be a part of the life of the mother of the Messiah. This very same thought had been expressed in the past by both Saint Bernard and Saint Thomas Aquinas.</p><p>St. Bernard said that \"St. Joseph remained chaste out of respect for Mary and he received the gift of the Bread from heaven to be shared with the entire world\". Here the words of the Book of Sirach come to fulfillment. \"For he who fears God behaves accordingly, and his friend will be like himself\" (Sirach 6:17). Mary is the woman who, more than anyone else, has the true fear of God. In return, God gives her Joseph, whom the Holy Spirit has shaped to resemble her.Saint Thomas Aquinas says that the marriage between Mary and Joseph is a true one even though it is not consummated, since in it we find the fundamental elements that guarantee the validity of a marriage: the union of souls, the union of hearts and the consensus. The intimate union between Mary and Joseph has much to say to married couples and to celibates as well. The more we fear the Lord, the more capable of friendship we will be, as attested by the Book of Sirach. Intimacy with God purifies the heart and makes it capable of giving and receiving love. Intimacy with God leads to purity and chastity of the heart, which in turns leads to intimacy with our brothers and sisters. If the heart of the husband and the wife are truly chaste, the union of their souls and the intimacy for which they strive will be even stronger.</p><p>If the heart of the celibate person is chaste, then there will be an intense intimacy between them and the people with whom they come into contact. Often the celibate life is misunderstood as an existence doomed to loneliness. The chaste heart is thought of as a cold heart, unable to love. If this were true, we'd reach the paradoxical conclusion that in order to be chaste and to love God we need to close ourselves up in fear to the love of our brothers and sisters. The heart of the celibate person instead is called to be loving towards all.</p><p>Both the married and the unmarried are called to be people who love passionately. The Second Person of the Trinity chose to use the love between Mary and Joseph to \"advance in wisdom and age and favor before God and man\" (Lk 2:52). Relationships with others are the means that God has chosen for us, so that we may progress in our relationship with Him. We learn how to love by loving. This is why from time to time we face dangers and temptations. This is where we need God's help to come and show us what it means to love another in the  concreteness of a situation. True love implies at times a drawing closer to the other, while in some circumstances we are invited to keep a healthy distance so to guarantee another's freedom.</p><p>To love truly means to put the other first, even when it costs much sacrifice and it hurts. Consider the words of the song \"When my Heart Bleeds\": \"My child, I love you, when my heart bleeds, your heart beats, you are mine.\" Even Mary's heart bled united with Jesus' heart. In the Mel Gibson's movie The Passion, there is a beautiful exchange when Mary at the foot of the Cross tells her Son: \"Flesh of my flesh, bones of my bones, let me die with you.\" A sword pierced her heart. The chaste heart is a pierced heart through which multiple graces flow as through a special channel.</p>"

    "Mother Most Chaste": {
        "eng": "<p>\"With me is strength, by me kings reign.\" Mary alone, of all human beings, after her Divine Son, was born free from the least stain of original sin. From this fact flow many consequences which are of importance for us to consider.</p><p> Mary was free from the least disorderly movement of nature, from the slightest surprise of passion or weakness, from every rebellion of the flesh against the spirit. Of her it could never be said that \"the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" Every part of her nature, her body, her soul, her spirit, was in perfect harmony, perfectly balanced. All her actions, thoughts, words, movements were perfectly under the control of reason, and her reason was completely subject to God.</p><p>In other words, she possessed the four cardinal virtues, prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance, in their perfection. It was not that she had not to work for her virtues. She revealed to a saintly nun by the name of Elizabeth, that she had acquired no virtue without effort and continual prayer. True, she had not that continual struggle to overcome evil tendencies born in her, that we have. Yet she was more vigilant in watching over herself, in denying herself, and in praying for grace than any human being ever has been.</p><p> All this harmonious perfection, this moderation, this self-control was in her the effect of the virtue of temperance, which means balance, restraint, moderation in all, especially bodily pleasures, eating, drinking, and all the enjoyments of the senses. Drunkenness, gluttony, and excessive love of pleasure are sins against the virtue of temperance. By nature we all love pleasure so passionately that we have need of continual watchfulness lest this love of pleasure lead us to do things forbidden by God.</p><p>Pleasure is not a sin; far from it. The abuse arises from loving pleasure so much that, in order to obtain it, we do not hesitate to commit sin. We must be able to draw back, to say \"No\" to ourselves, when reason tells us that we are going too far. What would happen, for instance, if a small child were allowed to eat and drink everything that pleased its taste? It would certainly kill itself before long. It has to be trained, and refused what is bad for it, and not allowed to eat too much even of what is good for it. It is much the same with our passions.</p><p>If Adam had not sinned, we should not have had any trouble in ruling our passions, and the senses, which are now so rebellious. Does it not often happen that we excuse a fault by saying: \"Oh! I really could not help it!\" We seemed to do the thing almost before we knew it was wrong. We were not sufficiently trained in self-control. It was not so with Our Blessed Lady. She, being conceived without sin, and with the gift of original justice, all her acts, as we have said, were under the control of reason; she could never be surprised into any sin, into anger, lying, sloth, greediness, or anything wrong, as we so often are. Yet she was always most guarded, most selfcontrolled, most mortified. The Saints tell us that she fasted continually. All this, and much more, is implied in the title, \"Mother Most Chaste.\"</p><p>It would be impossible to learn this great lesson of selfcontrol all at once. It is as if we had to take some terribly strong or violent dose of medicine, which would cause us great suffering if taken all at once, but instead is taken in small quantities. In the same way we should accustom ourselves to self-restraint in small doses, being on our guard when we find a thing very pleasant to nature, so as not to let it enslave us, not allowing our senses everything they crave for, cheerfully enduring small inconveniences, and so on, that we may gradually obtain a habit of self-control. It is only thus that we can hope to obtain the virtue of temperance in its widest sense, and become like to Our Mother Most Chaste. In this, as in all else, we must look to her, not only for example, but also for help, in the fight to subdue our lower nature. </p>"

    "The Most Holy Name of Mary": {
        "eng": "<p>Mary! A name so lofty, in the regal majesty of its sound and meaning - Mary, Maria, Miriam! It is a name as familiar to us as the name of our Mother, as the bells of the church, as the peaks of the mountains which send their friendly greetings to the valleys below. Mary! A thousand times we have prayed, sung, wept this name, in good and evil days. Millions of women are called by that name and it weaves a golden thread around even the plainest woman. Mary! Holding on to this name, grope the way through the darkness of life and death. It is the rosy dawn heralding the rising sun, Jesus, in the Gospels as well as in the hearts of men.</p><p>A beautiful wreath of interpretation has grown around this holy name of Mary; the name Mary is supposed to stem from the word, \"yam\" - sea; \"mar,\" \"mir,\" \"mor\" - bitter sea, mistress of the sea, or the best known, \"star of the sea.\" Others find profound meaning by tracing Mary to \"moras,\" - hope; \"mar\" the bitter one; \"maron\" the exalted one, \"moren,\" the rising one, \"marsh,\" the enlightener, \"mor,\" myrrh. All these are ingenious but are not etymologically tenable. In all probability, the name Mary goes back to the Egyptian language. The sister of Moses and Aaron, born in Egypt like her brothers, is the only woman mentioned in the Old Testament with this name. It can be derived from the Egyptian root, \"mir,\" love, and \"jam,\" \"jahu,\" Yahu, Yahwe, God; so that Mirjam means \"God-loving,\" or \"beloved of God.\" In Mary's time it was more common to derive the name from Maron, the Exalted One, corresponding to our Madonna, Notre Dame, Our Blessed Mother or Our Blessed Lady.</p><p>\"The name of Mary,\" says Saint Anthony of Padua, \"is sweeter to the lips than the honeycomb, more delightful to the ear than a sweet song, more entrancing to the heart than the purest joy.\"</p><p>\"Surely,\" says Saint Bernard, \"the Mother of God could not have a name more appropriate, nor one more impressive of her high dignity. Mary is in fact the beautiful and brilliant star which shines upon the vast and stormy sea of the world.\"</p><p>How we should honor this holy name of Mary; we should always invoke Father God, the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit, through His name. Tenderly must Jesus have spoken the name of His Mother.

    "Mother Most Pure": {
        "eng": "<p>Mary has been made more glorious in her person than in her office; her purity is a higher gift than her relationship to God. This is what is implied in Christ's answer to the woman in the crowd who cried out, when he was preaching, \"Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the breasts which thou hast sucked.\" He replied by pointing out to his disciples a higher blessedness; \"Yea, rather blessed,\" he said, \"are they who hear the word of God and keep it...\"</p><p>Protestants take these words in disparagement of our Lady's greatness, but they really tell the other way. For consider them; he lays down a principle that it is more blessed to keep his commandments than to be his Mother, but who even of Protestants will say that she did not keep his commandments? She kept them surely, and our Lord does but say that such obedience was in a higher line of privilege than her being his Mother. She was more blessed in her detachment from creatures, in her devotion to God, in her virginal purity, in her fullness of grace, than in her maternity. This is the constant teaching of the holy Fathers: \"More blessed was Mary,\" says St. Augustine, \"in receiving Christ's faith, than in conceiving Christ's flesh.\" And St. Chrysostom declares that she would not have been blessed, though she had borne him in the body, had she not heard the word of God and kept it.</p><p>This of course is an impossible case; for she was made holy that she might be made his Mother, and the two blessednesses cannot be divided. She who was chosen to supply flesh and blood to the Eternal Word was first filled with grace in soul and body. Still, she had a double blessedness, of office and of qualification for it, and the latter was the greater. And it is on this account that the angel calls her blessed. \"Full of grace,\" he says, \"blessed among women\"; and St. Elizabeth also, when she cries out, \"Blessed thou that has believed.\" Nay, she herself bears a like testimony, when the Angel announced to her the favor which was coming on her.</p><p>Though all Jewish women in each successive age had been hoping to be mother of the Christ, so that marriage was honorable among them, celibacy a reproach, she alone had put aside the desire and the thought of so great a dignity. She alone, who was to bear the Christ, all but refused to bear him. He stooped to her, she turned from him. And why? - because she had been inspired, the first of womankind, to dedicate her virginity to God, and she did not welcome a privilege which seemed to involve a forfeiture of her vow. \"How shall this be,\" she asked, \"seeing I am separate from man?\" Nor, till the angel told her that the conception would be miraculous and from the Holy Ghost, did she put aside her \"trouble\" of mind, recognize him securely as God's messenger, and bow her head in awe and thankfulness to God's condescension.</p><p>Mary then is a specimen, and more than a specimen, in the purity of her soul and body, of what man was before his fall and what he would have been, had he risen to his full perfection. It would have been hard, it would have been a victory for the Evil One, if the whole race had passed away, without one instance occurring to show what the Creator had intended it to be in its original state. Adam, you know, was created in the image and after the likeness of God. His frail and imperfect nature, stamped with a divine seal, was supported and exalted by an indwelling of divine grace. Impetuous passion did not exist in him, except as a latent element and a possible evil; ignorance was dissipated by the clear light of the Spirit; and reason, sovereign over every motion of his soul, was simply subjected to the will of God. Nay, even his body was preserved from every wayward appetite and affection and was promised immortality instead of dissolution.</p><p>Thus he was in a supernatural state; and, had he not sinned, he would have advanced in merit and grace and in God's favor year after year, till he passed from Paradise to heaven. But he fell; and his descendants were born in his likeness; and the world grew worse instead of better, and judgment after judgment cut off generations of sinners in vain, and improvement was hopeless, \"because man was flesh,\" and \"the thoughts of his heart were bent upon evil at all times.\"</p><p>But a remedy had been determined in heaven; a Redeemer was at hand; God was about to do a great work, and he purposed to do it suitably; \"where sin abounded, grace was to abound more.\" Kings of the earth, when they have sons born to them, forthwith scatter some large bounty, or raise some high memorial; they honor the day, or the place, or the heralds of the auspicious event, with some corresponding mark of favor; nor did the coming of Emmanuel innovate on the world's established custom. It was a season of grace and prodigy, and these were to be exhibited in a special manner in the person of his Mother. The course of ages was to be reversed; the tradition of evil was to be broken; a gate of light was to be opened amid the darkness, for the coming of the Just; a Virgin conceived and bore him. It was fitting, for his honor and glory, that she who was the instrument of his bodily presence, should first be a miracle of his grace; it was fitting that she should triumph, where Eve had failed, and should \"bruise the serpent's head\" by the spotlessness of her sanctity. In some respects, indeed, the curse was not reversed; Mary came into a fallen world and resigned herself to its laws. She, as also the Son she bore, was exposed to pain of soul and body. She was subjected to death, but she was not put under the power of sin.</p><p>As grace was infused into Adam from the first moment of his creation, so that he never had experience of his natural poverty till sin reduced him to it; so was grace given from the first in still ampler measure to Mary, and she never incurred, in fact, Adam's deprivation. She began where others end, whether in knowledge or in love. She was from the first clothed in sanctity, sealed for perseverance, luminous and glorious in God's sight, and incessantly employed in meritorious acts, which continued till her last breath. Hers was emphatically \"the path of the just, which, as the shining light, goeth forward and increaseth even to the perfect day.\" And sinlessness in thought, word, and deed, in small things as well as great, in venial matter as well as grievous, is surely but the natural and obvious sequel of such a beginning. If Adam might have kept himself from sin in his first state, much more shall we expect immaculate perfection in Mary.</p>"

The faithful first called upon Mary with the title \"Mother of God\". \"Mother of the faithful\" or \"our Mother\", to emphasize her personal relationship with each of her children.</p><p>Later, because of the greater attention paid to the mystery of the Church and to Mary's relationship to her, the Blessed Virgin began more frequently to be invoked as \"Mother of the Church\". Before the Second Vatican Council, this expression was found in Pope Leo XIII's Magisterium, in which it is affirmed that Mary is \"in all truth mother of the Church\" . The title was later used many times in the teachings of John XXIII and Paul VI.</p><p> Although the title \"Mother of the Church\" was only recently attributed to Mary, it expresses the Blessed Virgin's maternal relationship with the Church as shown already in several New Testament texts.</p><p>Since the Annunciation, Mary was called, to give her consent to the coming of the messianic kingdom, which would take place with the formation of the Church.</p><p>When at Cana Mary asked the Son to exercise his messianic power, she made a fundamental contribution to implanting the faith in the first community of disciples, and she co-operated in initiating God's kingdom, which has its \"seed\" and \"beginning\" in the Church .</p><p>On Calvary, Mary united herself to the sacrifice of her Son and made her own maternal contribution to the work of salvation, which took the form of labour pains, the birth of the new humanity.</p><p>In addressing the words \"Woman, behold your son\" to Mary, the Crucified One proclaims her motherhood not only in relation to the Apostle John but also to every disciple. The Evangelist himself, by saying that Jesus had to die \"to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad\" (Jn 11:52), indicates the Church's birth as the fruit of the redemptive sacrifice with which Mary is maternally associated.</p><p>The Evangelist St Luke mentions the presence of Jesus' Mother in the first community of Jerusalem (Acts 1:14). In this way he stresses Mary's maternal role in the newborn Church, comparing it to her role in the Redeemer's birth. The maternal dimension thus becomes a fundamental element of Mary's relationship with the new People of the redeemed.</p><p>The title \"Mother of the Church\" thus reflects the deep conviction of the Christian faithful, who see in Mary not only the mother of the person of Christ, but also of the faithful. She who is recognized as mother of salvation, life and grace, mother of the saved and mother of the living, is rightly proclaimed Mother of the Church.</p><p>Pope Paul VI would have liked the Second Vatican Council itself to have proclaimed \"Mary Mother of the Church, that is, of the whole People of God, of the faithful and their Pastors\". He did so himself in his speech at the end of the Council's third session , also asking that \"henceforth the Blessed Virgin be honoured and invoked with this title by all the Christian people\".</p><p>In this way, my venerable Predecessor explicitly enunciated the doctrine contained in chapter eight of Lumen gentium, hoping that the title of Mary, Mother of the Church, would have an ever more important place in the liturgy and piety of the Christian people.</p>"

The idea of God as our Creator is that which most fills us with awe and reverence towards Him and a sense of our own utter nothingness.  We have got accustomed to say, \"Mother of Our Creator,\" so that we are not so much impressed by it, but let us try to realize what it means.  The great God Who made us, Who has absolute and entire control over every part of our being, and everything belonging to us, and before Whom we are but as little grains of the dust of which we are made!  Think of His choosing one of these little creatures of His to be His own Mother, with all the rights that a mother has over her child; what an idea of the greatness of Mary will then be ours!</p><p>That the great Creator should be her very own Child, absolutely dependent on Her for His being, His life, His support, His food  -  can we ever realize how great must be Her power, when the very God Who had made Her put Himself completely in Her power?  \"He Who created me rested in my tabernacle.\"   If we were to begin our meditations on Our Lady by this thought, we might be overcome with awe at the idea of Her greatness; and so this title does not occur till far on in the Litany, after we have deeply reflected on Her kindness, Her gentleness, Her love, Her many winning attributes, so that we shall not be frightened of this great Queen of Creation.</p><p>Very often the people we love and trust, or who love us, cannot do for us what we wish, or what they wish, for they have not the power.</p><p>But what a consolation to reflect that with Mary, who loves us so much more than anyone on earth can do, this can never be the case.   She who is so loving, gentle, kind and compassionate, is equally powerful.   There is literally nothing that She cannot do.  We may say of Her what Our Lord says of Himself: \"All power is given to Her in Heaven and on earth.\"   On earth She gave Herself and everything She had to Our Lord, and He, Who is the most tender, the most grateful and affectionate of sons, will deny nothing to His Mother.   Whatever She asks of Him, that He will do.</p><p>Even on earth, in the days of Their poverty, Our Lord showed Mary the greatest respect.  At a simple suggestion from Her, \"they have no wine,\" He advanced the time of His miracles, and worked His first wonder.   He even told Her that His hour had not yet come, and yet because it was His Mother who asked, He did what She desired: He changed the water into wine.  Thus would He show us what was the reverence of the Creator for His Mother.</p><p>St. Antoninus says: \"The prayers of the Blessed Virgin, being the prayers of a mother, have in them something of a command, so that it is impossible that She should not obtain what She asks.\"  Our Lord said that He came into the world, not to break the law, but to observe it, and the law commands us to honor our father and our mother.  Other saints say that Our Lord is a debtor to His Mother, for Her consent to give Him His human nature, and thus, \"the Son, as if paying a debt, grants Thee all Thy petitions.\"</p><p>One day St. Brigid heard Jesus say to Mary: \"Ask of Me what Thou wilt.  For no petition of Thine can be void; because Thou didst never deny Me anything on earth, I will deny Thee nothing in Heaven.\"</p><p>But we must ourselves ask Her help.  God has made this the law: \"Ask, and you shall receive, seek, and you shall find.\"   We must exert ourselves to ask for graces.  God is so good that He gives us many, many graces that we do not ask for; but the more we ask, the more we shall receive.   \"The hungry He hath filled with good things,\" Mary Herself tells us.   His law is that we obtain grace by prayer.  Go then, with all confidence to Mary, the Mother of Our Creator, and ask for whatever you desire, be it little or great; She heeds not whether our requests are little or great, for She can do all.  You will never be refused, no matter what your trouble is.  \"Let us go with confidence to the throne of grace,\" says St. Paul.  The tabernacle where the Creator rested is that \"throne of grace.\"  By Mary's help you will prevail, for She, being the Mother of the all-powerful Creator, is omnipotent by Her intercession.</p>"

This title is not only the source of incomparable greatness in her, it is also a potent means to ground us firmly in the true faith, and to bring us to a more perfect knowledge of the divine attributes. What glory accrues to the Goodness of God from the Divine Maternity of Mary! For, in predestining Mary to be the Mother of the Word, God also decreed to give her to us as our Mother. He willed that she should accomplish in union with her Son the work of our Redemption, and that by regenerating us to the life of grace, she should become our Mother in the spiritual order.</p><p>The Divine Maternity is the starting point of the work of our salvation.

[2 Cor. 8:9] Therefore doth Jesus Christ exhort each one who desires to be His disciple, If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor ... and come, follow Me. [Matt. 19:21]</p><p> Behold Mary, His most perfect disciple, who indeed imitated His example. Father Canisius proves that Mary could have lived in comfort on the property she inherited from her parents, but she preferred to remain poor, and reserving only a small portion for herself, distributed the rest in alms to the temple and the poor. Many authors are of opinion that Mary even made a vow of poverty; and we know that she herself said to St. Bridget, \"from the beginning I vowed in my own heart that I would never possess anything on earth.\" </p><p>The gifts received from the holy Mary cannot certainly have been of small value; but we are assured by St. Bernard. that she distributed them to the poor through the hands of St. Joseph. That the Divine Mother immediately disposed of these gifts is also evident from the fact, that at her purification, in the temple she did not offer a lamb, which was the offering prescribed in Leviticus for those who could afford it, for a son she shall bring a lamb; [Lev. 12:6] but she offered two turtle doves, or two pigeons, which was the oblation prescribed for the poor: And to offer a sacrifice, according as it was written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons. [Luke 2:24] Mary herself said to St. Bridget, \"All that I could get I gave to the poor, and only reserved a little food and clothing for myself.\"</p><p> Out of love for poverty she did not disdain to marry St. Joseph, who was only a poor carpenter, and afterwards to maintain herself by the work of her hands, spinning or sewing, as we are assured by St. Bonaventure. The Angel, speaking of Mary, told St. Bridget that \"worldly riches were of no more value in her eyes than dirt.\" In a word, she always lived poor, and she died poor; for at her death we do not know that she left anything but two poor gowns, to two women who had served her during her life, as it is recorded by Metaphrastes and Nicephorus.</p><p> St. Philip Neri used to say that \"he who loves the things of the world will never become a Saint.\" We may add what St. Teresa said on the same subject, that \"it justly follows that he who runs after perishable things should also himself be lost.\" But, on the other hand, she adds, that the virtue of poverty is a treasure which comprises in itself all other treasures. She says the \"virtue of poverty;\" for, as St. Bernard remarks, this virtue does not consist only in being poor, but in loving poverty. Therefore did Jesus Christ say, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. [Matt. 5:3] They are blessed because they desire nothing but God, and in God they find every good; in poverty they find their paradise on earth, as St. Francis did when he exclaimed, \"My God and my all.\"</p><p>Let us, then, as St. Augustine exhorts us, \"love that one good in which all good things are found\" and address our Lord in the words of St. Ignatius, \"Give me only Thy love, with Thy grace, and I am rich enough.\" \"When we have to suffer from poverty, let us console ourselves,\" says St. Bonaventure, \"with the thought that Jesus and His Mother were also poor like ourselves.\" </p>"

This tender scene speaks to us of the depth of the Love which inspires, informs, and transforms all human love, the Love Incarnate who gives us His Mother.</p><p>Christian Art and the Tradition of the Church are filled with reflection on the profound mystery and implications of this gift of a Mother named Mary to the Church. She was a real mother who was privileged to, (along with Joseph), raise the One who lived within her for nine months after He was born.

She was there throughout the often called \"hidden years\" in Nazareth. In the life of the Redeemer, every word and every act was redemptive, revealing as it does the very life of God, the mystery of heaven touching earth, and the deeper purpose of our own lives. She was there in those moments whose impact is timeless. They are still as filled with the invitation of grace today as they were when they first occurred.</p><p>She was there on the great day of Pentecost, the birthday of the Church.

That response was not a onetime reaction. It was the fruit of a life of surrender and stretched forward to characterize her whole life on this earth and her participation in the eternal communion of Saints. The Prayer of Mary is more about being than doing. It is about surrendered love to God.</p><p>Her \"Fiat\" (Latin, let it be done) in response to the visitation from the messenger of heaven, the angel, provides a pattern of prayer and a way to live for us. It immediately issues forth in the fruit of her praise, her \"Magnificat.\" She said \"Yes\" to the invitation to love and she humbled herself. She confronted her own fears and she entered into a way of living. All of this was in continued response to an original invitation of love, a gift, initiated by a loving God.</p>"

At the very mention of the Holy Name of Jesus, the Saints felt the most intense delight. St. Bernard said that it was music to his ears, sweetness to his taste, joy to his heart. He declared that whatever he heard gave him no pleasure unless Jesus were the theme.</p><p>Jesus means Savior. We all know this, but do we now and then reflect upon it?</p><p>There was once, we are told, somewhere in Spain, a crucifix which had this peculiarity, that one arm was detached from the nail and hung down at one side. It was said that it had once hung upon the wall of a confessional, where a sinner confessed an atrocious crime, and the priest, appalled, hesitated to give him absolution. But what was the amazement of both priest and penitent when they heard sobs issuing from the crucifix, from which the hand of Our Lord detached itself and gave absolution to the poor sinner, while at the same time a voice was heard saying to the priest:\"You have not shed your blood for this poor sinner, as I have.\"</p><p>This is only a story, which may or may not be true, but it symbolizes exactly a certain truth, of which it gives us some faint idea, and that is what it means to be Savior. It is at the price of His Precious Blood that Christ has saved us from sin and its consequences.</p><p>He has brought us peace, pardon, grace and the love and friendship of God. Without these blessings, which have only come to us through Our Savior, we should be the most miserable of creatures, even if we had all the riches and pleasures of this world. Why? Because only the love of God and the possession of His grace can fill and satisfy the hungry soul of man. St. Augustine says: \"Thou hast made us for Thyself, O God, and our heart is restless until it finds rest in Thee.\" Only God can satisfy that mysterious craving for something, we know not what, which is in every human soul, and which we all feel at some time or another, and which we so often try in vain to satisfy by running after earthly loves and pleasures.</p><p>It is Jesus, Our Savior, Who alone can give us that which can satisfy the deep longing of our soul.</p><p>Perhaps we have never reflected upon or realized what it means when we say that Christ is Our Savior, or what it is that He has saved us from. But if we had lived in the world as it was before He had given us His Church and His Sacraments, we should know too well. It is Our Lord Who has brought all kindness and gentleness and peace into the world. Before that most men were hard and cruel and selfish. Those who were rich and powerful and strong, crushed down the poor and weak and wretched as a matter of course. The horrors of slavery show how men can treat one another without the Law of Charity which Our Lord teaches in the Gospel. We should not like to have lived in that world. Children did not have a good time then. Think of the innumerable child lives sacrificed in the horrible worship of Moloch, for instance, \"parents sacrificing with their own hands helpless souls,\" \"merciless murderers of their own children,\" as we read in the Book of Wisdom. In ancient Rome parents could put their children to death, if they thought fit. Helpless prisoners, again, were treated with horrible cruelty, and tortured before death. Our Lord had not yet come to teach that it was a blessed work of mercy \"to visit the imprisoned.\" There were no Sisters of Mercy or Charity to attend to the poor, the sick and the afflicted. Now that Our Lord has shed His Precious Blood for each single soul, we know that souls are the most precious things in the world, and that every human being, even the puniest, poorest child, has sacred rights that must be respected. Those who love Jesus will make any sacrifice to save a single soul, no matter how poor, or wretched, or repulsive it may be. And Our Lord has expressly said that whatever we do to the least of His brethren, we do to Him. All this beautiful charity and pity and tenderness we owe to Our Savior. All the kindness and charity in the world had its beginnings in the teaching and example of Our Savior Jesus Christ.</p><p>And after God, it is to His Mother, Mary, that we owe Jesus. She gave Him of Her substance for His human life; She nursed and fed, and took care of Him as a Babe, She worked and lived and suffered that we might have a Savior. That was the whole meaning of Her life. This is what it means to be the Mother of the Savior, to suffer in all that He suffered for us. She stood by the Cross on Calvary, and gave Him up as a Victim for our sins. Let the title, \"Mother of Our Savior\" always remind us how dear and precious our souls are to Mary, since She, too, paid, in Her compassion for Her Son, the price of our ransom.</p><p>But Our Lord's Life was for us, too, as well as His Death, His Birth, His Infancy, Childhood, Hidden and Public Life, His Miracles, His Resurrection, and Ascension. We were, every one of us, in His mind, in all that He said, and did, and suffered, all the time. All of it was for each one of us, as if we were the only ones. No one of us can be passed over, each one is as precious as another. Why? Because the same price was paid for every single soul of man. The only thing that makes any one of us of any value is the price we cost Our Lord, His Precious Blood. We may never look down on anyone; no matter how repulsive, or uninteresting; all men are of the same value as we are, in the eyes of God, they cost the same price, they are, every one of them, as we are, infinitely precious.</p><p>Who can teach us the mysteries of Our Savior as Mary can? She was an indispensable part of every one of them. As the Wise Men of old found Jesus \"with Mary His Mother\" so must we. We must ask our Mother, the Mother of Our Savior, to teach us how much we all need Him. His Most Precious Blood has to be applied to each one of our souls in the Sacraments, we shall never get to Heaven without Him, and it is through His Mother we reach Him.</p><p>No one ever appreciated Our Savior and His salvation, as did Mary. \"My spirit hath rejoiced in God My Savior.\" She alone fully realized what it meant. How many times in the Scripture does God show us that He would have us, too, rejoice in Jesus, Our Savior, and in our salvation. \"Ye shall draw waters in joy from the fountains of the Savior;\" \"I will exult in God my Savior;\" \"My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation;\" \"in Thy salvation he (the king) shall rejoice exceedingly;\" \"restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation;\" etc.</p>"

It may even become, if we do not combat it, the source of deadly falls. Our lot, then, is indeed most pitiable, and St. Paul had reason to exclaim: \"Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\"  (Rom. vii, 24.) But thanks be to God, who has procured for our weakness an unfailing support, for which we must be eternally grateful to Him: this is divine grace, by which we can avoid every mortal fault, and moreover keep ourselves free from venial transgressions, if not for the whole course of our life, at least for lengthy periods. This grace is even so fruitful, that besides the strength it gives us to resist concupiscence, it also furnishes us with a potent means for increasing merit. \"God,\" says St. Paul, \"will make also with temptation issue.\" (l Cor. x, 13.)</p><p>Mary, having contracted no stain of original sin, was thereby free from that concupiscence which is its fruit, and which consists in the rebellion of the inferior part of the soul against the superior.

Consequently, she never committed the slightest venial sin, which consists in the rebellion of our unruled passions against the law of reason. Further, by an altogether special privilege, Mary's will was so assisted by the Holy Spirit, that it was never alienated from God by mortal sin. It is therefore the privilege of our Queen to have been exempted from all stain of sin, even the slightest, during the whole course of her mortal career.</p><p>Oh, how Jesus delighted in the soul of His Holy Mother!

These, by reason of the vision of the Divine Essence, which they behold face to face, are incapable of sin: whilst Mary, who was not in possession of the beatific vision, absolutely speaking, might have fallen from divine grace. But she had this advantage over the Blessed in heaven, that her sinlessness did not prevent her from acquiring merits, whilst the saints in heaven can no longer do so.</p><p>Indeed, though Mary did not feel, as we do, the temptations of the flesh, nor experience the difficulties which we encounter in performing acts of virtue, nevertheless, her merits went on continually increasing to an inconceivable extent during her whole mortal life. Merit is increased in proportion to the ardor of the will, and Mary's will was ever prompt to execute the commands of God, howsoever difficult they might be. The Holy Mother of God being without shadow of sin, and being in all her actions prompted by the most fervent charity, was able, as theology teaches, to merit for man de oongruo all that Jesus Christ, by His passion and death, merited for us de condigno.</p>"

Christ spoke of the common things He saw around Him, of the vines, the fig-trees, the corn-fields ripe for the harvest, the cockle among the wheat, the sheep and the shepherds, water, bead and wine, trees and fruits, seed-time and harvest-time; and from all these common, homely objects He drew spiritual lessons for our benefit.</p><p>If we turn to the Old Testament, the Book of Wisdom especially, we find the same truth insisted on - that we are to learn from natural objects and the daily occurrences around us, from the ant and the bee, from the birds, and the insects, and the seasons.</p><p>All this should bring home to us the truth that in every cranny of the world of Nature we can find some divinely intended lesson - that the things of the earth, passing as they are, are shadows, emblems, and types of things spiritual and eternal.</p><p>What then is the lesson of flowers?

To the waiters, in Her eagerness to give help, She says: \"Whatsoever He shall say to you, do ye.\"</p><p>St. Thomas says that he who loves God, loves all that God loves. St. Catherine of Genoa one day said to Our Lord: \"Lord, Thou willest that I should love my neighbor, and I can love none but Thee.\" And Our Lord said: \"All who love Me love what I love.\" And we have seen that what Our Lord loves above all is souls, the souls that He died to save. St. Bonaventure tells us that it was said of Mary that She was \"eager to serve.\" \"See,\" he says, speaking of the marriage feast of Cana, \"see Our Lady eager to serve, solicitous, alert in handling things round, and directing the servants how and what to offer to the guests.\"</p><p>What a great and admirable thing that is, to be eager to serve others! We should all aim at this: it will be the remedy for many of our faults, for pride and selfishness and vanity and self-occupation, and it will make us resemble Jesus and Mary, for Jesus says of Himself, \"I am in the midst of you as one that serveth.\" Let this be our first thought wherever we may be, \"How can I help?\"</p><p>Mary loves what Her Divine Son loves, and hence She loves souls. On Calvary, when She saw Jesus, Her one Treasure, tortured, agonizing, bleeding, insulted, there was no ill-will against the executioners in Her mind, but She freely offered Her Son for their salvation and that of the whole world. Like Jesus, She \"loved to the end.\"</p><p>But we must not be satisfied with merely gazing upon Our Mother, the Mystical Rose, we must strive with all our hearts to imitate Her in Her love for God and man. We shall then be Her little mystical rosebuds, and She will look down on and bless these blossoms of Her own beloved virtue. \"Be ye merciful, as your Heavenly Mother is merciful,\" we may imagine Mary saying to us.</p><p>Let the thought of Our Mother, as the Mystical Rose of Charity, help us then, to fight those difficulties in the way of charity which everyone must have. Charity is not an easy virtue, though by practice it becomes delightful. There is the difficulty of forgiving those who have hurt us, who annoy us, who dislike us, of being kind to those who are unkind to us, not saying sharp things when we are cross and hurt, and of overcoming selfishness in all its manifestations, fighting for what we like, and what we want, not caring at all what others like or want.</p><p>Remember Mary's words: \"They have no wine.\" Her one thought was to spare others suffering, shame, and confusion, and even when Jesus said that His hour was not yet come, She still exerted Herself to help: \"Whatsoever He shall say to you, do ye.\" Do not, then, always wait till you are asked to do a kind deed. Be on the watch to see how you can serve others and help them, and you will, in your own sphere, resemble your Mother, the Mystical Rose, in Her love and charity.</p>"

But He came forth glorious and transfigured for the divine and infinite wisdom decreed and ordained that the glory of his most holy soul should in His Birth overflow and communicate itself to his body, participating in the gifts of glory in the same way as happened afterwards in His Transfiguration on mount Tabor in the presence of the Apostles.</p><p>\"It was the will of God that the most blessed Virgin should look upon the body of her Son, the God-man, for this first time in a glorified state for two reasons. The one was in order that by this divine vision the most prudent Mother should conceived the highest reverence for the Majesty of Him whom She was to treat as her Son, the true God-man. Although She was already informed of His two-fold nature, the Lord nevertheless ordained that by ocular demonstrations She be filled with new graces, corresponding to the greatness of her most holy Son, which was thus manifested to Her in a visible manner.</p><p>\"The second reason was to reward by this wonder the fidelity and holiness of the divine Mother; for her most pure and chaste eyes, that had turned away from all earthly tings for love of her most holy Son, were to see Him at his very Birth in this glory and thus be rejoiced and rewarded for her loyalty and beautiful love.</p><p>\"The sacred evangelist Luke tells us that the Mother Virgin, having brought forth her firstbegotten Son, wrapped Him in swathing clothes and placed Him in a manger. The two sovereign princes, Saint Michael and Saint Gabriel, were the assistants of the Virgin on this occasion. They stood by at proper distance in human corporeal forms at the moment when the incarnate Word, penetrating the virginal chamber by divine power, issued forth to the light, and they received Him in their hands with ineffable reverence. In the same manner as a priest exhibits the sacred host to the people for adoration, so these two celestial ministers presented to the divine Mother her glorious and refulgent Son.</p><p>\"In the same moment in which the holy angels thus presented the divine Child to His Mother, both Son and Mother looked upon each other, and in this look, She wounded with love the sweet Infant and was at the same time exalted and transformed in Him.\"</p>"

There is a separate room in the church which houses many important relics, including the crown of thorns and one of the nails from Christ's Passion, a fragment of the True Cross, among other relics. Veneration of the Crown of Thorns takes place on the first Friday of the month, and also on Good Friday.</p><p>The city of Paris was evangelized in the 3rd century, and in the year 250 the pope sent them their first bishop, Saint Denis. At that time the Christians were being persecuted throughout the Roman Empire, so Catholics practiced their faith in secret. Saint Denis was martyred within a few years, but his successors continued until Constantine became emperor and ended the persecution.</p><p>The first church was built at about that time as an expression of the faith of the people, but the Gothic Cathedral of Notre Dame of Paris presently occupying the spot was begun in 1163 by Bishop Maurice de Sully. There is a legend that he had a vision of a glorious new cathedral in Paris, and that he himself had drawn the outline for it on the ground where the cathedral now stands. The cornerstone was laid in the presence of Pope Alexander III, but it was not until 1345 that the cathedral was basically completed. The style was a new one, and Notre Dame was one of the first cathedrals to make use of flying buttresses to allow for the large stained-glass windows, including the world famous rose window.</p><p>In the year 1548 the cathedral was damaged by Protestants, and various tombs and stained glass windows were destroyed. It was probably at about this time that the incident the Abbot Orsini refers to occurred. In 1793 the cathedral suffered desecration during the French Revolution, and much of the art and many of the relics were damaged or stolen. The cathedral was for a time used as a warehouse to store food.</p><p>In 1801 the cathedral was given back to the Catholic church, and in 1804 the coronation ceremony of Napoleon I took place there. The Cathedral of Notre Dame has been repaired and restored several times since then, and is now again in use for its intended purpose.</p>"

    "Our Lady Abbey of Royaumont": {
        "eng": "<p>It was actually in the year 1228 when King Saint Louis IX of France planned for the construction of a new church for the honor or God and His Blessed Mother in the Valley of the Oise. He and his mother Blanche left their palace to reside at nearby Chateau d'Asnieres to be able to direct their efforts to the building of the new church. After purchasing the land himself, the king changed the name from Cuimont to Royaumont.</p><p>It was certainly nothing unusual to see the monks assisting in the construction of their own church, but Saint Louis himself labored enthusiastically alongside the workmen and stone masons. Many of the king's family members followed his good example, so that soon there were many French noblemen working throughout the site. But that is not all, for when the monks sat down to eat at their Refectory, the king waited on over one hundred monks as they ate at two long tables. First, he would sample their food before setting it before anyone, and then he would taste their wine to be certain it was up to his own personal standard. If he were not satisfied, the king would demand a better vintage for the religious. One Maundy Thursday he would wash the feet of the beloved monks of Royaumont.</p><p>When the church was completed, it was so wondrous a work that \"it was said at the time that none but a king could have constructed such an edifice.\" A purely Gothic style church, having \"a nave which both astounded and alarmed by its colossal height and boldness\" that reached nearly the height of Notre-Dame in Paris, it was a labor of love made by Saint Louis to God and His Blessed Mother. When it was finished, King Louis was wedded there to Marguerite, the beautiful daughter of Beranger IV. The king allocated five hundred livres to be given yearly to the support of the Abbey.</p><p>There was also an infirmary attached to the monastery, and among those who were cared for was a leper by the name of Frere Legier. At that time lepers were isolated and treated as social outcasts. The leper's disease would slowly kill them, but even while they were alive most were usually treated as if they were already among the dead.</p><p>King Louis, instead, took a personal interest in the leper. He would visit him frequently with the Abbot, saying: \"Let us go and visit our patient.\" Then together they would enter Legier's isolated cell and kindly greet the horrifically disfigured patient. The king would then speak with Legier familiarly and inquire as to his condition before preparing a sumptuous meal for him with his own hands. The King would then feed the leper with loving attention, waiting on him to finish his repast as he continued to converse with him as if he were the equal of the King of France.</p><p>If one were to visit Royaumont today, they would find the ruined church with little more than the outer walls, and a few of the surrounding buildings that are still in good condition. Royaumont, like so much that spoke of the love of God in Catholic France, was a victim of the French Revolution.</p><p>It was the Marquis de Travannet who had purchased Royaumont from the state when he was ordered to destroy the venerable old church. The Abbey Church easily withstood the discharge of mines that were meant to destroy it, but later the central pillars were sawn through. Massive chains were cast through the stained glass windows that had lighted the interior of the church for centuries, and then attached to those pillars. Pulled by teams of oxen, the roof of the church fell in with \"a salvo of flying fragments amid shouts of diabolical triumph,\" so that nothing now remained but the outer walls.</p><p>In 1812 the Maruqis allowed his brother, the Vicomte de Travannet, to establish his cotton manufacturing business there, employing English prisoners to do the needed labor. He paid dearly for his sacrilege, even in this life, as he was soon denounced with his brother and both arrested. Narrowly escaping the guillotine, he was eventually freed, although the privations he had suffered while incarcerated soon led to his death. The cotton business thus failed, and the equipment was sold in the year 1815 to a cotton magnate from Belgium named Joseph Vander Mersch. Although Mersch seemed to have a certain respect for the ruins, replacing them where they once stood whenever possible, he also met with an early death and a failed business. It was during the time that he owned Royaumont, though, that the pilgrimages began.</p><p>It was on the feast of King Saint Louis IX in the year 1865 when the Abbey was acquired by the Oblate Fathers. Though Royaumont was once again in Catholic hands, they had no ability to rebuild the church from the ruins. In fact, only five years later, they were obliged to sell the Abbey to the Sisters of the Holy Family, of Bordeaux. They in turn sold the property in 1905, by order of the Government, and thus ended the dream of Saint Louis IX of France, whose good works are safely held by God in the treasury of heaven.</p>"

He requested a copy for the many Irish Catholics in his diocese who would be happy to learn the history and to possess the picture of Our Lady of Ireland. The copy was placed face to face with the original and then given to Bishop Schrembs. On August 23, 1914, Archbishop Schrembs dedicated the new St Stephen's Church in Toledo, Ohio.

Chartres was surrounded by a strong wall which held the Vikings in check, so the Vikings were forced to lay siege to the city, his men spoiling the surrounding countryside as the days progressed.</p><p>Eventually Duke Robert and Duke Richard assembled an army south of Chartres to oppose the fierce Vikings.

Besides the spring already mentioned, there were a number of churches already built in the area, but the greatest of them would be the Church of St Mary of Blachernae.</p><p>When all was ready, the emperor sent a message to Juvenal, the first Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, asking him to send the sacred remains of the Blessed Virgin Mary to them to be honored in the new church dedicated to Our Lady.</p><p>It is the tradition of the Church that Our Lady passed the remaining days of her life at Jerusalem, and it was commonly known that the tomb of the Blessed Virgin was located in Gethsemani.

It is Byzantine in style and is supposed to have been painted in the thirteenth century. It represents the Mother of God holding the Divine Child while the Archangels Michael and Gabriel presenting  Him the instruments of His Passion. Over the figures in the picture are some Greek letters which form the abbreviated words Mother of God, Jesus Christ, Archangel Michael, and Archangel Gabriel respectively.</p><p>The icon  was brought to Rome towards the end of the fifteenth century by a pious merchant, who, dying there, ordered by his will that the picture should be exposed in a church for public veneration. It was exposed in the church of San Matteo in the famous Roman street of Via Merulana, which connects the basilicas of Saint Mary Major and Saint John Lateran. Crowds flocked to this church, and for nearly three hundred years many graces were obtained through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin. The picture was then popularly called the Madonna di San Matteo. The church was served for a time by the Hermits of Saint Augustine.</p><p>These Augustinians were still in charge when the French invaded Rome (1812) and destroyed the church. The picture disappeared; it remained hidden and neglected for over forty years, but a series of providential circumstances between 1863 and 1865 led to its rediscovery in an oratory of the Augustinian Fathers at Santa Maria in Posterula.</p><p>Pope Pius IX, who as a boy had prayed before the picture in San Matteo, became interested in the discovery. But at that time, the ruins of San Matteo were in the grounds of  a convent of the Redemptorists -the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer-,  founded by St. Alphonsus Liguori  (1696-1787). </p><p>The Father General of the Redemptorists, Most Rev. Nicholas Mauron, decided to bring the whole matter to the attention of the Pope.  The Pope listened attentively and felt sure it was God's will that the icon should be gain exposed to public veneration and the logical site was their church of St. Alphonsus, standing as it did between the Basilicas of St. Mary Major and St. John Lateran.  The Holy Father at once took a piece of paper and wrote a short memorandum ordering the Augustinian Fathers of St. Mary in Posterula to surrender the picture to the Redemptorists, on condition that the Redemptorists supply the Augustinians with another picture of Our Lady or a good copy of the icon of Perpetual Help.</p><p>The Icon meant much to the Augustinians, but when the two Redemptorists came armed with the Pope's signed memorandum, what could they do but obey?  On January 19, 1866, Fathers Marchi and Bresciani brought the miraculous picture to St. Alphonsus' church.  Preparations were now made to inaugurate the new public reign of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. On April 26th, a great procession was staged in which the picture was carried throughout the Esquiline region of Rome.  Upon returning to the church, the picture was enthroned over the high altar, in a resplendent shrine-niche especially constructed for it.</p><p>The report of  marvelous healings spread rapidly throughout the city of Rome and people came by the hundreds to visit the shrine.  Soon the whole area around the altar was filled with abandoned crutches and canes and several whole glass-covered cabinets were filled with gold and silver thanksgiving offerings in the shapes of miniature hearts, arms, legs and other votive offerings.  Scarcely two weeks after the solemn exposition of the picture, Pope Pius IX himself came to visit the shrine.  He stood quietly before it for a long time and then exclaimed: \u201cHow beautiful she is!\u201d.</p><p>Pope Leo XIII, the next pontiff, had a copy of the picture on his desk so that he might see it constantly during his working day.  St. Pius X sent a copy of the icon to the Empress of Ethiopia and granted an indulgence of 100 days to anyone who repeated the phrase: \u201cMother of Perpetual Help, pray for us.\u201d</p><p>Pope Benedict XV had the picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help placed immediately over his chair of state in the throne room.  Here it could be seen by all just over his head, as if to say: \u201cHere is your true Queen!\u201d.</p><p>Pope Pius IX told the Redemptorists, in speaking to them of the treasure he had committed to their care: \u201cMake her known!\u201d  It seems as though they hardly needed the exhortation.  In the United States, they built the first Our Lady of Perpetual Help church in the Roxbury section of Boston, and it was eventually raised to the honor of a \u201cPapal Basilica\u201d by Pope Pius XII.</p><p><strong><em>Symbolism of the icon of Perpetual Help</em></strong></p><p>The influence of Eastern icons in the West, around the XII and XIII centuries brought a class of icons called Cardiotissa, from the Greek word kardia, meaning heart.  Cardiotissa means \u201chaving a heart\u201d or showing sympathy and mercy and compassion.  In them the face of Our Lady appears full of sorrow, yet supremely dignified in her contemplation of the sufferings of her Son.  His passion is represented by angels holding instruments of His passion, most often the cross, the lance, the sponge, and the nails.</p><p>The Our Mother of Perpetual Help icon is of this type. The angels holding the instruments of the Passion have their hands covered with a protecting veil as a sign of reverence in handling sacred objects.</p><p>The Child Jesus is shown with an adult face and a high brow, indicating His divine Mind of infinite intelligence.  As God, He knew that the angelic apparition was prophetic of His future passion.  Yet in His human nature as a small child, He is frightened and runs to His Mother for protection. Our Lady hastily picks Him up and clasps Him to her bosom.  This action is indicated by the fact that the Lord's right foot is nervously curled about the left ankle and in such haste that His right sandal has become loosened and hangs by a single strap.  Further action is indicated by the way the Child Jesus clasps His Mother's right hand with both of His, holding tightly to Our Lady's thumb.</p><p>Our Lady is clothed in a dress of dark red which was long reserved in the Byzantine world for the Empress alone, indicating the Queenship of Mary.</p><p>Some commentators on color claim that bluish purple became the color of penance in the Western Church (during Lent and Advent) because purple is a combination of blue and red.  The blue reminds us of heaven, to which we wish to arrive by our penance, and the red recalls martyrdom, because all penance requires a dying to oneself, especially mortifying inordinate desire for food and pleasure.  The archangels Gabriel and Michael were tunics of purple since they carry the instruments of the passion and death of Christ.  The figures of the icon are identified with abbreviations of their names and Mary is designated by her chief title to glory: Mother of God.</p><p>Our Lady's face is of unspeakable majesty and calm and yet her large eyes, partly closed, express ineffable sorrow and sympathy.  Our Lady is not looking at Jesus, but rather to us,  to express compassion for us in our fears and sorrows.</p>"

Our custom of saying, \"God Bless you,\" to someone who sneezes came about at this time, for sneezing was one of the signs that someone had contracted the disease.</p><p>Even the Roman Pontiff died of the plague on February 7th, 590. His successor was Pope Saint Gregory the Great, who was both a humble and pious man. It would be an understatement to say he did not want the honor of being the next pope, but he did do everything in his power to try to save his people. He understood that the plague was a chastisement from God, and encouraged the faithful to repent of their sins and pray for deliverance while he and the religious cared for the people of Rome.</p><p>Finally, Saint Gregory called for a procession to take place at dawn on April 25th. On that day the faithful first assembled in their groups throughout Rome and then walked through the streets of the city praying and singing as they approached the church of Saint Mary Major. The plague was so potent at that time that eighty people collapsed and died as they walked toward the meeting place.</p><p>Pope Saint Gregory met them upon their arrival, joining them in prayer as he took his place with them holding aloft the miraculous image of Our Lady painted by Saint Luke the Evangelist. As the procession neared the Vatican the participants all saw Saint Michael the archangel standing upon the cupola of Hadrian's mausoleum as he sheathed his flaming sword. It was a sign that the chastisement had come to an end, and at once the heaviness in the air abated and the air itself seemed to freshen and clear. Indeed, at that moment the plague ended as the faithful rejoiced and lifted up their voices to thank the Mother of God.</p>"

    "The Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary": {
        "eng": "<p>The feast of the Presentation was instituted in the Greek church more than nine hundred years ago, since Saint Germanus, who held the see of Constantinople in the year 715, composed a sermon upon it.</p><p>Mary's Presentation, offering, in the Temple was the greatest a creature ever made to God; at the age of three, she offered Him not spices, nor animals, nor precious metals, but herself as a perpetual victim to His honor. She well understood the voice of God calling her to devote herself entirely to His love.</p><p>God willed that from that time on she should forget all, and think only of loving and pleasing Him. Promptly and immediately, she obeyed the Divine Call.</p><p>Mary's offering at her presentation began really in her mother's womb, her sanctification at the instant of her Immaculate Conception. At that moment she received the use of reason and began to merit - the general opinion of theologians. (The Angels and our first parents had this blessing also.) In the first moment of her existence she offered herself entirely to God, and devoted herself without reserve to His love and glory, subjecting her will thereto.</p><p>The immaculate child understood that her holy parents, Joachim and Anne, had promised God by a vow to consecrate their child to Him for His service. Mary was reminded that it was the ancient Jewish custom to take daughters to the temple for education.</p><p>So when Mary was three years old, Joachim and Anne set out with her from Nazareth, eighty miles from Jerusalem, accompanied by choirs of unseen angels. When they reached the temple, Mary fell upon her knees, kissing the hands of her parents, and imploring them for their blessing. Then she ascended the fifteen steps of the temple and presented herself to the priest, Saint Zachary, for the service of her Creator.</p><p>Mary well knew that God does not accept a divided heart; so she vowed virginity, desiring to remain in the temple service her whole life. Our Lady revealed to Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, that she kept one special commandment before her eyes constantly:</p><p>\"Thou shalt love the Lord Thy God,\" and she implored of God the grace to keep all the laws and to live to see the Mother of the Redeemer; and that even she had to pray for grace and virtue always. On learning from Scripture that God was to be born of a virgin, her soul was inflamed with such love, and she begged to be the servant of that happy virgin.</p><p>Saint John Chrysostom tells us God found on earth no other virgin more holy and more perfect than Mary; nor a dwelling more worthy than her sacred womb, and so He chose her for His Mother - surpassing in perfection and virtue all other creatures.</p><p>As Mary did, offer yourself promptly and completely to God through her, without delay, without reserve, entreat her to offer you to God. He will not reject a creature offerd to Him through His Mother, the living temple of the Holy Ghost, the delight of the Lord and the chosen Mother of the eternal Word.</p><p>Have unbounded confidence in Mary, who rewards the homage of her clients with the greatest love.</p>"

    "Purification of Our Lady": {
        "eng": "<p>Besides commemorating the presentation of Christ in the Temple, this day has another meaning, for it is called Candlemass Day. The candle is one of the most widely used sacramentals in the Church; one blessed in a special Mass.</p><p>We use candles at Baptism, at Mass and other church services, at the ordination of a priest, the consecration of a bishop, at Easter, at Christmas to signify the coming of Christ. Two blessed candles should be in every home, to use in times of sickness, death, storms and calamities.</p><p>In the blessing of candles the Church reminds us that the candles signify light; they are blessed for the service of men, for health of body and soul, for those who desire to carry them in their hands with honor. Christ, the true Light and Fire of Charity, is asked to bless these candles; to dispel the darkness of night, to free us from the blindness of vice and to discern what is pleasing to Him and profitable for our salvation.</p><p>On the Feast of Mary's Purification, we greet her with lighted candles  -  shining with faith and understanding, burning with love and zeal, as Sion welcomed Christ the King; today we go to Christ through Mary, to Christ, the new Light that gives Faith, Hope and Charity to us all.</p><p>The two-fold Jewish rites to which the Holy Family submitted on this occasion were the legal purifying of the mother after childbirth and the offering of the first-born male child to the Lord. They showed reverence for the Father's Law by fulfilling its obligations, and so the Mother submitted to the Purification in all humility.</p><p>Angels beheld in wondering awe what was the greatest event the Temple had ever witnessed. It was nothing less than the second coming of the Lord to His Temple, which the prophets had foretold. At the Presentation, God the Son made Man took possession of the Temple built for His Father's glory, and so ratified the worship which is offered to God in sacred courts, churches.</p><p>This simple ceremony is the link between the mystery of the Incarnation and the Redemption; here the Savior renews the oblation of Himself; \"Sacrifice and oblation Thou wouldst not; but a body Thou hast fitted to me. Then, I said: \"Behold, I come: in the head of the book it is written of me that I should do Thy will, O God.\"</p><p>Jesus really begins His Passion in this mystery of the Presentation; and so, too, Mary begins her dolors. It is by Mary's hands that Jesus makes the oblation which is the prelude to His Sacrifice. We reckon the Presentation among the joyful mysteries, but it is also first in place among Mary's Sorrows.</p><p>Simeon enlightened by the Holy Spirit, understood the mystery and so, too, did Mary. After his first transports of joy at seeing the Messiah, he blessed them and said to His Mother, \"Behold this Child is set for the fall and the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted, and they own soul a sword shall pierce, that out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed.\"</p><p>This prophecy reminds us that Mary is always to be associated with the destiny of Jesus, the one solitary partner of His lot, singled out to suffer with Him. Heresies that pierced the Son have transpierced the Mother. The early Church guarded the doctrines of Jesus by defining Mary's titles; today those who repudiate the honor of Mary, turn from the Son also; in the mind of satan as in the mind of the Church, the honor of Son and Mother go together.</p><p>This feast reminds us how intimately Mary is associated with her Son in the work of Redemption. We welcome Her Child to our hearts with love and faith, we bless the Mother, too; for she had \"not spared her life by reason of the distress and tribulation of her people, but has prevented our ruin in the presence of our God.\"</p>"

    "Queen Conceived without Original Sin": {
        "eng": "<p>Our Lady of LourdesIf there is one doctrine of the Catholic Church which is misunderstood and misrepresented outside the Church, it is the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. Many who laugh at the idea of the fall and original sin, and therefore are forced to claim their own immaculate conception, refuse to grant that privilege to Mary. It is hard to understand their animosity to Her. They are afraid to grant any privileges to Her. She, they declare in effect, is no better than themselves, yea worse, and they like to believe that Jesus not only did not honor Her, His Mother, but even humiliated and insulted Her. There is no logic in them. Their whole scheme of argument is this  -  \"the Catholic Church honors Mary, therefore, we, to show our antipathy to the Church, must belittle Her.\" But the truth is, reverence for the Most Holy Mother of God is a mark of a true follower of Her Divine Son.</p><p>Others confuse the Immaculate Conception with the Virgin Birth. The most uneducated Catholic knows the difference (yet, after Vatican II, there are many so-called Catholics who do not). The Virgin Birth has reference to Christ. It means that when the Word of God became Man, Incarnate, His Body was formed of the flesh of the Virgin Mary alone, without any intercourse with man, by the Holy Ghost. Before the Birth, in the Birth, and after the Birth, His Mother remained a Virgin, knowing not man.</p><p>The birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary was not a \"virgin birth.\" Her parents, Ss. Joachim and Anne, cooperated with God in the formation of Her body. This is the physical aspect of conception. But the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is focused primarily on the spiritual aspect - the creation of Her holy soul by God and its infusion into her body. As Pope Alexander VII declared centuries ago: \"Concerning the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, ancient indeed is that devotion of the faithful, based on the belief that Her soul, in the first instant of its creation and in the first instant of the soul's infusion into the body, was, by a special grace and privilege of God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, Her Son and the Redeemer of the human race, preserved from all stain of original sin. And in this sense have the faithful ever solemnized and celebrated the Feast of the (Immaculate) Conception\" (Apost. Const. Sollicitudo Omnium Ecclesiarum, Dec. 8, 1661).</p><p>When Adam and Eve were created and their souls infused into their bodies, they were without sin, hence immaculate. But they fell, sinned, lost the state of sanctifying grace, and would have been banished forever from the sight of God, only that God in His Infinite Goodness promised to redeem them, to take them back, and in due time did send His Only-Begotten Son to become Man and redeem them. But meanwhile every descendant of Adam and Eve, by that sin of the first parents, contracted the debt - contracted original sin. At the moment a soul is infused into the body, it is deprived of holiness, deprived of original justice; the soul is spiritually dead, and in the state of enmity with God. But it is not a hopeless case. By the mercy of God, it is possible, in view of the merits of the Redemption, for this soul in the state of original sin to be repaired, to be spiritually regenerated, to receive sanctifying grace and all the virtues and gifts which that state brings, and to become again an heir of Heaven. This is what God does for us in Baptism.</p><p>It was different with Mary - in such a way that She was a unique exception. Mary was indeed redeemed by God, but there is a difference between Her case and ours. God redeemed Her, but by an anticipated Redemption. He let sin come into our souls and then later took it away; but He prevented sin from coming into Her soul. He redeemed us by reparation; He redeemed Her by preservation. A homely example, though not entirely accurate, may help to explain this. I have a sheet of white paper. My pen drops a blot of ink upon it. Then I erase it and make the paper clean again. Or, I see the drop of ink about to fall, and to prevent it dropping on the paper I turn the pen aside and let the drop fall on a blotter, or somewhere off the paper. In one case I clean the paper by reparation, in the other I keep it from becoming unclean by prevention, or preservation. Thus Mary was preserved from getting the blot of sin; was sanctified at Her creation.</p><p>Dogma of Immaculate Conception DetailSo that the essence of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is the absence of all stain of original sin. This is the definition of the Church: \"We pronounce and define that the doctrine which holds that the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first moment of Her Conception, by a singular privilege and grace of Almighty God, in view of the merits of Christ Jesus Our Savior, was preserved immaculate from all stain of original sin, is revealed by God and therefore is to be firmly and confidently believed by all the faithful\" (Pope Pius IX, Apost. Const. Ineffabilis Deus, Dec. 8, 1854).</p><p>There is this to be added to the consideration of Her Immaculate Conception: when we are freed from original sin by Baptism the moral effects of Adam's sin are removed, but the physical consequences, pain and disease and death, the struggle between good and evil, remain. But by Her Immaculate Conception, there never was any sin, hence never any concupiscence, disease, or necessary death. She was all holy, with a supremacy of sanctity.</p><p>The Immaculate Conception, defined December 8, 1854, is of course not a new teaching in the Catholic Church. Though not declared explicitly, it was always taught implicitly. When it was defined, it was to be believed by all with explicit faith, that is, \"as a distinct and separate dogma, no longer (merely) involved in the general belief of what the Church teaches\" (Cardinal Wiseman). Implicitly the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception was contained in that of Her Divine Maternity and Her Perfect Purity. We have already seen, in considering other titles of Hers, the numberless \"all holy,\" \"all pure\" titles the Church has given to Her. What else can they mean but Her absolute sinlessness at all times, which includes Her Immaculate Conception?</p><p>That has always been the belief of the faithful of the Catholic Church. Pope Pius IX tells us, \"The Fathers and writers of the Church, well versed in the heavenly Scriptures, had nothing more at heart than to vie with one another in preaching and teaching in many wonderful ways the Virgin's supreme sanctity, dignity, and immunity from all stain of sin, and Her renowned victory over the most foul enemy of the human race\" (Ibid.) God sometimes allowed controversy on the part of some theologians, as has happened so often in the history of the Church, but this was in order that the truth might be defined more explicitly.</p><p>Innumerable popes had upheld the belief in the Immaculate Conception, but things began to come to a head under Gregory XVI. He granted to the churches of France, America, England, Germany and Italy, at their request, an indult to introduce into the Preface of December 8 the words et te in Conceptione Immaculata, as the Franciscans had it. Much was contributed to the cause by the rapid spread of devotion to the Miraculous Medal, with its - \"Mary, conceived without sin,\" revealed to St. Catherine Labour\u00e9, and also by the sensational conversion, by means of the Medal, of the Jew Alphonse Ratisbon. To Pope Gregory petitions came from all over the world for the dogmatic definition of the doctrine. It was a spontaneous movement. The movement so increased under Pope Pius IX, that he felt impelled to issue an encyclical to all the Bishops of the Church, February 2, 1849, asking them to let him know their own sentiments and the sentiments of their clergy and people. He had appointed a Council of twenty theologians to weigh the question thoroughly and report on all the authorities they could get from ancient writers, liturgies, and ecclesiastical documents. Then a special commission of theologians was appointed. They reported that the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception could be dogmatically defined, and that it was seasonable to define it. Six hundred and two letters were received from Bishops all over the world, expressing their belief in the Immaculate Conception; only a few of them questioning the opportuneness of defining it then. Wiseman tells us that sovereigns, heads of religious orders and innumerable others, wrote letters, enough to fill nine octavo volumes. All over the world Masses were said, people prayed, received Holy Communion, for the cause. The Pope invited to Rome Prelates to represent the hierarchy of every country. They came from all over the world, representing fourteen different languages.</p><p>At eight o'clock on the morning of December 8, 1854, all were gathered in the Sistine Chapel. Soon the Pope, with his court, arrived. One hundred fifty-two Bishops in silver copes and white miters, fifty-one mitered Cardinals, were in the procession to St. Peter's, where nearly forty thousand people were gathered. After the Gospel the Pope began to read the decree, his speech broken by his tears and sobs, so great was his emotion. Cardinal Wiseman says there was scarcely a dry eye in the congregation. Out in the city cannons roared, bells rang, proclaiming to the world that the Vicar of Christ had just defined the Immaculate Conception. A striking incident is related by the same Cardinal Wiseman. For several days, up to the evening before the eighth, there was a gloomy atmosphere, torrents of rain, and, the day after, the same conditions prevailed, but on December 8 the sky was serene and beautiful, the sun shone forth in splendor.</p><p>The title of Our Lady under Her Immaculate Conception has a special appeal to Americans, since we are under Her special patronage. Many nations have been consecrated to the Immaculate Conception. As long ago as 1615, Spain and its dependencies were placed under the Immaculate Conception. We are told that even today Spaniards greet one another with, \"Ave Mar\u00eda Pur\u00edsima - Hail Mary Most Pure!\" and the answering greeting is, \"Sin pecado concebida - Conceived without sin!\" At one time every artist had to take an oath of belief in the dogma. In 1650 the Blessed Virgin, under the title of the Immaculate Conception, was proclaimed Patroness of Ireland.</p><p>When Alexander O'Reilly came to Louisiana, in 1769, as Spanish Governor of the Province, he made all the officials take this oath: \"I swear before God on the Holy Cross and the Evangelists to maintain and defend the mystery of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady, the Virgin Mary.\" America belongs in a special way to Our Lady, from north to south, from east to west. Every missionary to our shores brought Her with him. Rivers and lakes were mapped out under Her name. Settlements were called after Her, so that America was Our Lady's dowry long before it was a nation. The Jesuits, Franciscans, and others had remembered that one of their principal reasons for existing was to bring honor to the Mother of God.</p><p>Mary was several times chosen Patroness of the United States, but in the Sixth Provincial Council of Baltimore, May, 1846, devotion to the Immaculate Conception was solemnly discussed by the American prelates. On May 13 they decreed: \"The Fathers, with ardent desire and with unanimous applause and consent have chosen the Blessed Virgin conceived without original sin as the Patroness of the United States...\" the decree was approved by the Holy See on February 19, 1847. Permission to add to the Litany the title, \"Queen Conceived without Original Sin\" had already been granted on September 13, 1846.</p><p>So Mary, in the definition of the Immaculate Conception, was crowned under one of Her loveliest titles. Her apparition at Lourdes a few years later, 1858, and Her declaration to St. Bernadette - \"I am the Immaculate Conception\" - was a further proclamation of Her delight in this title. It is a title so dear to every Catholic, the glorification of our Mother. And so we sinners pray for the intercession of the sinless one: \"O God, Who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin didst prepare a worthy dwelling-place for Thy Son, we beseech Thee, that Thou, Who through the foreseen death of that same Son of Thine, didst preserve Her free from all stain, wilt grant that we also by Her intercession may come to Thee, through the same Christ Our Lord\u2026 Amen.\"</p>"

    "Queen of All Saints": {
        "eng": "<p>When Pope Pius VII was a prisoner in France, he made a vow that if he were delivered, he would place a crown of gold on the statue of Our Lady of Loreto. He was freed, and fulfilled his vow with great solemnity on May 13, 1814. He saluted Mary as \"Queen of All Saints.\"</p><p>St. Aelred has a tribute to Our Lady that is like a poem: \"The Spouse of Our Lord is surely Our Lady; the Spouse of Our King is surely Our Queen.\" The title \"Queen of All Saints\" ought to have a special appeal to us all, for it is by this title that She is, in anticipation, our very own Queen, since, by the grace of God, we hope to be numbered among the saints in Heaven one day. Hidden saints, hidden to the world, but known to God and Mary. We used to have in the Seminary an old priest who made much of the Feast of All Saints. \"It is your feast,\" he would say, \"the only feast you will ever have.\" No, we shall probably not be canonized martyrs, or confessors, or virgins - but we hope to be of that \"great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and in sight of the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands\" (Apoc. 7: 9).</p><p>The first in that throng of created beings, angels or men, is Mary, so immeasurably above them all that She is, as it were, a distinct creation. St. Anselm says: \"O Lady, nothing equals Thee: for all is either above Thee, and this is God alone, or beneath Thee, and this is all that is not God.\" We have already discussed in many places Mary's holiness, that supremacy of sanctity which is greater than the holiness of all the angels and saints taken together. It is that holiness, given to Her because She is the Mother of God, which makes Her Queen of All Saints, the immeasurably greatest of all the saints. That is the prime meaning of the title, the proclamation of Her personal holiness. The secondary meaning has a very special interest for us. It is that the saints in Heaven regard Her and venerate Her as their Queen, not only because of Her dignity as Mother of God and Her personal sanctity, but because, if they are saints at all, they owe it, after God, to Her intercession. We have but to recall what we said before about Mary being our Mediatrix, that all graces given to men are dispersed by God through Her hands. Even those who do not know Her, those who ignore Her, belittle Her in their ignorance, receive whatever actual graces they get through Her hands. More so because She is not a mere instrument, but our Intercessor, \"our Life, our Sweetness, and our Hope.\" The saints know that well enough. They did not have to reach Heaven to discover that. They realized it on earth, and that is why they are in Heaven today. The saints have been Mary's greatest glorifiers. Their sanctity began when they recognized Her supreme sanctity. St. Teresa of Avila, for example, set out on the high road to sanctity the day she chose Mary for her Mother after her own earthly mother had died. The Little Flower abandoned herself to sanctity that day when as a child, thought to be dying, she begged Our Lady to have pity on her, and Our Lady answered Her by smiling upon Her. \"The expression of Our Lady's face was ineffably sweet, tender and compassionate; but what touched me to the very depths of my soul was Her glorious smile.\"</p><p>St. Catherine and the StaircaseSt. Catherine of Siena was a saint, when as a child of seven she climbed the stairs in the Benincasa house and stopped on every step to say an Ave. But why go on? In the life of every saint you will find a solid devotion to the Mother of God. You will never find any mawkish sentimentality in the writings of the saints. They are too level-headed for that. Their feet are firmly set upon the ground, even though their heads are above the clouds and their souls swimming in ecstasy. Sometimes their speech is beyond us to comprehend. We poor earthlings cannot follow St. Teresa of Avila or St. Peter of Alcantara in their deep mysticism, but they are solidly Catholic in their theology, solidly Catholic in their devotion to Our Lady. The language they use in speaking about Her is the simple language we all know. That is one of the marks of the Catholic, the common-sense way in which he speaks about the Mother of God. The great spiritual writers have soared to celestial heights on wings of divine poetry, but the heart of their eulogies of Mary is the very same as the simple prayer of a child singing one of Fr. Faber's hymns to Her.</p><p>The greater the saint, the greater his love for Mary. The greater the saint, the more he recognizes Her sanctity; and, conversely, the more he recognizes Her sanctity, the more inspiration he gets to pursue sanctity. St. Gertrude, a common sense saint, indeed, yet a deep mystic, knew that. We, too, can pray the prayers she prayed. There is one beautiful prayer of hers which we poor sinners can make our own, as well as she, the mystic:</p><p>O fairest Lily, Thou sweetest Mary, who art, after God, my greatest, surest hope, speak Thou on my behalf in the presence of Thy dear Son; speak for me but one effectual word. Plead my cause with all Thy loving devotedness; obtain for me in Thy goodness the object and aim of my desires; for in Thee do I trust, in Thee, who art, after Jesus, my one and only hope. Show Thyself towards me a Mother full of tenderness; obtain for me that I be received by Our Lord into the hiding-place of His love, into that school wherein the Holy Ghost teacheth. For above all others canst Thou obtain for me this favor from Thy Divine Son. O Mother Most Faithful, surround Thy daughter with Thy thoughtful care, that I may become an ever-living fruit of love; that I may grow in all holiness, and that the dew of Heaven may uphold my perseverance.</p><p>Coronation of the Blessed Virgin MaryThe whole of Mariology is in that prayer. St. Gertrude, as all the saints, knew that Mary is an expert in the making of saints, and hence her deep devotion to Her. It was the simplicity of childlike love, for the great saint is a simple saint, often speaking in loving exuberance. To them nothing was too good for the Mother of God. The last words the Little Flower wrote were these: \"O Mary, were I Queen of Heaven, and wert Thou Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, I should wish to be Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, that I might see Thee Queen of Heaven\" -  a thought modeled after the one of St. Augustine: \"O God, if I were God and Thou wert Augustine, I would wish to be Augustine, that Thou mightest be God.\" Exaggeration, you may say, but at the heart of the two expressions is overwhelming love that will not be curbed by words.</p><p>And if the saints while on earth loved Mary so much, what must their love and gratitude be to Her now when they are beholding Her in Heaven. We have little idea of what blessedness it is to see God face to face. \"Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard.\" Nor can we appreciate the blessedness of seeing the glorified Mother of God. Our Lady has appeared many times on earth since Her Assumption, but \"beautiful Lady\" that She was to St. Bernadette and others, the vision was necessarily tempered to their earthly eyes. They could not have seen Her as She is and lived. On the authority of many saints, we could not gaze upon the beauty of a soul in the state of grace and live. Now the saints see Her in Heaven. When we say that, we can say no more, for it is beyond us to visualize what they see. It is all summed up by St. Albert the Great, when he says: \"Mary could not be more closely united to God without becoming God.\" It is an inspiration to us, who hope to be joined to that host of saints one day.</p><p>Meanwhile we are on our way. We are, please God, saints in the making. \"Thy sons shall come from afar, and thy daughters shall rise up at thy side\" (Is. 60). We all want to save our souls, and thus be saints finally. We all want to go home. And the beauty of it is that we know how to get there. Not only does our Mother keep a light in the window to show the way, but She comes to get us, to take us by the hand and lead us - rather She carries us. She hears us when we sing, in the Ave Maris Stella, \"Show Thyself a Mother;\" in the Memorare, \"O Virgin of virgins, our Mother;\" in the Salve Regina, \"Mother of Mercy.\" The more we love Her, the more we pray to Her; the more She loves us, the more She prays for us.</p><p>Our sorrow is that we do not love Her more. Fr. Faber says: \"There can be no repentance in Heaven, else when we see Mary we shall wish we had known Her better, prayed to Her more often, and loved Her more; for we shall see brighter places than our own, further forward in the glory of Heaven, where we might have been had we loved Her more!\"</p><p>So our souls are filled with new zeal, new determination to win at last the place that is prepared for us at the foot of the throne of the Queen of All Saints.</p>"

    "Queen of Angels": {
        "eng": "<p>Origin of the Regina CoeliWe read in the Bible (Eccli. 45: 14) that when Aaron was consecrated to the priesthood, a crown of gold was placed upon his miter. The crown had a second fillet of blue lace, a color chosen as the type of Heaven, \"an ornament of honor, a work of power, and delightful to the eyes for its beauty.\" Over this crown was a golden diadem, with the inscription, \"Holiness to the Lord.\" The diadem, a fillet of silk, was two inches wide, sometimes white, sometimes blue, sewn with pearls or other gems and enriched with gold. It may be noted that the diadem, not the crown, was the real insignia of royalty. How applicable to Mary, the Queen of Heaven, is this diadem with its blue fillet, Her own color, the color of the firmament.</p><p>One of the loveliest and truest titles of Mary is that of Queen - Mary, by the grace of God is Queen and Empress of the universe. St. Athanasius says: \"If the Son is a King, the Mother who begot Him is rightly and truly considered a Queen and Sovereign.\" And St. Bernardine of Siena: \"No sooner had Mary consented to be Mother of the Eternal Word, than She merited by this consent to be made Queen of the world and all creatures.\" Holy Mother Church has guaranteed that royal title to Her. In the Mass of the Seven Dolors She sings: \"Holy Mary, the Queen of Heaven and Mistress of the world, stood by the Cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ full of sadness;\" and in the Communion Verse of the Mass of Our Lady of Mount Carmel: \"Most noble Queen of the world, Mary, ever Virgin.\" Three of the four great Antiphons of Our Lady salute Her as Queen, the Regina Coeli, the Ave Regina Coelorum and the Salve Regina - \"Hail, Queen of Heaven, Hail Mistress of Angels!\"</p><p>So are applied to Her the words of the Psalmist (Ps. 44: 10), \"The Queen stood on Thy right hand in gilded clothing, surrounded with variety.\"</p><p>There is a beautiful story about the Regina Coeli. In the year 596, at Easter Time, a terrible pestilence was raging in Rome. Pope St. Gregory urged the people to do penance, and arranged for a procession (see image at right). At dawn he went to the Church of Ara Coeli, and taking a picture of Our Lady, believed to have been painted by St. Luke, he led the procession to St. Peter's followed by the clergy and a great crowd. When the procession was passing the tomb of Hadrian he heard heavenly voices singing the Regina Coeli, and he added to their praises the invocation, Ora pro nobis, Alleluia! At that, an Angel was seen putting his sword back into its scabbard. The plague had ceased. Thenceforth the Castle of Hadrian was known as the Castle of the Holy Angel (Castel Sant'Angelo), and the Image of Our Lady became known as the Salvation of the Roman People (Salus Populi Romani). Being Queen of Heaven, the first title of Her royal prerogatives is \"Queen of Angels,\" an astounding title as we consider the unspeakable beauty and majesty of these sublime creations of God.</p><p>Angel means \"one going\" or \"one sent,\" hence a messenger. The Angels are God's instruments to tell His Will to men, but their essential function is to serve at the throne of God. Daniel (c. 7) gives a magnificent picture of them: \"I beheld till thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days sat: His garment was white as snow and the hair of His head like clean wool; His throne like flames of fire: the wheels of it like burning fire: a swift stream of fire issued forth before Him; thousands of thousands ministered to Him and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before Him; the judgment sat and the books were opened.\" St. Thomas divides the Angels into three hierarchies of three orders each: first, the Seraphim, the Cherubim and the Thrones; second, the Dominations, the Virtues and the Powers; third, the Principalities, the Archangels and the Angels. We cannot go into a detailed study of the Angels - it is enough to say that they were created before man, and that they are a superior creation to man: \"Thou hast made him (man) a little less than the angels\" (Ps. 8, 6).</p><p>Queen of AngelsThe tremendous thought is that Mary is the Queen of Angels; that She, who by nature is inferior to them, is in dignity superior to them, due to the fact that She has the supreme dignity - that of Mother of God. Her close association with Jesus in the Incarnation made Her an associate of the Angels. It was God's way of manifesting His Will to Her. The great messenger of the Annunciation was St. Gabriel. He saluted Her, as the one inferior salutes the one superior. Even St. Gabriel was awed at the beauty of Mary's soul and the dignity which no angel could even hope for. St. Gabriel, \"the strength of God,\" had appeared to the Prophet Daniel, he had appeared to Zachary; they were holy men and pleasing to God, but She was \"full of grace,\" and he knew that while in that little house of Nazareth he was in the very vestibule of Heaven, the very first one to salute the Queen of Angels. We still have that feeling of St. Gabriel's awe every time we repeat his Ave, a feeling like to that of the boy St. Aloysius or little St. Catherine of Siena, climbing the stairs and saying an Ave at every step, or St. Louis of France adding to his other prayers fifty Aves and genuflecting at every one. Say Ave Maria, and you still hear the flutter of St. Gabriel's wings and smell the flowers from the fields of Paradise. But St. Gabriel was not the only angelic visitor to Mary. There were hosts of Angels to wait upon Her, ready to do Her slightest bidding, hovering about Her, in admiration of Her, and in adoration of Her Child. It is not a bit of merely poetic sentiment that makes the artists surround Her with Angels. Where else would they be but with the King of Angels and the Queen of Angels?</p><p>But there was one Angel in particular that guarded Mary. It was St. Michael the Archangel. When the powers of Satan, in the person of Herod, sought to destroy the Child Jesus, and Mary and Joseph were forced to flee with Him into Egypt, St. Michael went with Them. \"Michael and his angels fought with the dragon... and that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan...\" (Apoc. 12: 7, 9) The Woman clothed with the sun conquered by the aid of St. Michael. He never left Her. It is the accepted belief that it was he who came to Mary at the end to announce to Her that She was going to die. We can well believe that he stood guard over that holy body till it was reunited with Her soul, and that he blazed the way with his golden wings to glorify Her path to Heaven. St. Michael had driven Lucifer from Heaven; what must have been his happiness to accompany Mary to Her throne there!</p><p>\"Thy throne the wings of Angels!\" (1910 Raccolta, N. 211) Our poor minds cannot grasp the rejoicing of the Angelic hosts at the Assumption of their Queen. \"Mary is assumed into Heaven,\" sings Holy Church, \"the Angel hosts rejoice.\" That is the thought over and over again in many of the Feasts of Our Lady and the Angels - that the Angels rejoice to have Her as their Queen.</p><p>There is an old legend that St. Mauritius (431 A.D.) instituted the Feast of the Nativity of Mary, due to the fact that on the night of September 8, a man heard the Angels singing in Heaven, expressing their joy on the birthday of their Queen. The Copts call that day the Feast of the Seed of Jacob, reminding us of Jacob's Vision, the ladder of Heaven with Angels ascending and descending.</p><p>It is not hard to accept the story that Angels carried the Holy House of Nazareth to Loreto. They loved that dwelling-place of God and Mary who had dwelt there many a year. It was the palace of their Queen.</p><p>It was so even while She was on earth; more so, when She was glorified in Heaven. St. Anselm has a beautiful passage on Her Assumption. \"No longer is She solicitous how to serve Him as a Child, for all the hierarchies of Angels serve Him as their Lord. No longer is She troubled flying with Him into Egypt from the face of Herod; for He has ascended into Heaven, and Herod has gone down into Hell before His face. No longer is She disturbed on account of the many things the Jews did against Him; for all things now are subject unto Him. And now Mary Herself is exalted above the choirs of Angels; now all Her desire is fulfilled, She sees God face to face, as He is, and rejoices with Her Son forever.\"</p><p>The truth of this, that Mary is the Queen of Angels, is of tremendous importance to us. Every one of Her titles means something to us, is of practical importance to us. The great thought is this - that since She is set above the Angels, since She is the nearest being to God, and since She is also our Mother, our advocate, our mercy, our life, our sweetness, our hope, there can be no limit to the confidence we place in Her intercession.</p>"

    "Queen of Apostles": {
        "eng": "<p>The apostles understood better than anyone else the great privileges of Mary. They realized her sanctity; they recognized her virtues; they knew how she had cooperated in the work of redemption; they knew how Jesus loved her. During the public life of Christ they were closely associated with the Blessed Mother. They were with her through the suffering of our Lord. With Mary they persevered in prayer in the upper room, waiting for the coming of the Holy Spirit. During this long association, even before the death and resurrection of Jesus, the apostles came to know her as their Queen and Mother.</p><p>Great must have been her zeal and joy when she could preach Christ crucified, living in herself, as she abode, during the years in pagan Ephesus with the Beloved Disciple. Her Son was no longer a hidden God, but One on High, risen from the dead. Mary perhaps converted many by her spotless life, where the virtues of a Christian shone the more gloriously because set in a pagan land.</p><p>Mary is Queen of the Apostles in another sense. The apostles were zealous but they had their defects. They sometimes showed lack of courage, faith, humility and meekness. Mary, on the contrary, had every virtue in perfection, especially those of the true missionary-zeal and the spirit of sacrifice. Mary merited the title Queen of Apostles by years of exile in foreign countries among pagans. She saw mission life in all its phases.</p><p>We need the example and inspiration of Mary to convert the world. We need her virtues to win the world to her Son. It will strengthen all who are interested in spreading the Faith, to reflect that Mary spent so many of her days on earth among the heathen. Thank God, our missionaries, our modern apostles, our priests and sisters and brothers, and lay people in the missions, take her for their model.</p><p>A feast of Mary under the title Queen of Apostles is observed in Pallottine Redemptorist churches and other churches. It has a proper Mass; the collect refers to the coming of the Holy Spirit upon Our Lady and the Apostles, and asks Almighty God that, under Mary's protection, \"we may be enabled faithfully to serve Thy majesty, and by word and example to spread abroad the glory of Thy Names.\"</p>"

    "Queen of Confessors": {
        "eng": "<p>Most of Our Lady's titles, as we have seen, are two-fold in their application. They concern Her and those who model their lives after Her. So in the present instance the title \"Queen of Confessors\" first of all proclaims Her as the greatest of all confessors, and secondly the Queen, Patroness, Model of all confessors of the Faith, especially the canonized heroes.</p><p>The name \"Confessor\" has through the ages varied somewhat in meaning, though remaining substantially the same. It was employed in the early ages for a particular body of Christians - those, who though not actually martyrs by shedding their blood, were really martyrs in spirit. There were many persecuted Christians who were not punished with death. Haled before the magistrates on the charge of worshiping Christ and refusing to worship the pagan gods, they were, if they persisted in their adherence to the new Faith, convicted of treason and condemned to punishment. They were tortured within an inch of their lives, their property was confiscated, they were banished into exile, they were confined in prison dungeons, they were chained and forced to work in the mines. To many of them death would have been welcome, quick relief. But they were deprived of death. Life was a long, lingering martyrdom, like to that of Our Lady Herself. Thus the Church honored, next to the martyrs, these heroes of the Faith, who persevered to the end in their sufferings entailed by their confession, or profession, of Faith in Jesus Christ.</p><p>When such persecutions ceased, the confession of the Faith, however, did not cease. There were many who carried the cross in heroic virtue, who were true apostles of the Kingdom of God, spending their lives in the desert doing penance, preaching on the missions, writing books in their monasteries, the Anthonys, the Patricks, the Benedicts. The people revered these holy men, knew them to be saints, and honored their memories by building chapels and invoking their intercession.</p><p>Queen of ConfessorsThe meaning of the name has not much changed since then. Now it is more specific, and is confined to those heroes of the Faith whose sanctity has been manifested by miracles and who have been canonized by the Church.</p><p>Taking the word in the sense of one who has professed Christ heroically, it is plain that Mary, apart from Her martyrdom, is the greatest of all confessors, the very Queen of Confessors. It began with Her beginning. In all these considerations we never lose sight of the prerogatives of Her Immaculate Conception and Her infused knowledge, Her use of reason, Her supremacy of sanctity from the beginning. She was a Confessor of Faith in God even then. The Church seems to indicate that, by saying to Her, in the office of the Feast of the Presentation -  \"Blessed art Thou, Mary, who hast believed.\" Her baby feet were taking their first steps on the missionary way.</p><p>The test of faith, and all that was entailed by the profession of that faith, came when Mary was asked to be the Mother of God on Annunciation Day. It was a tremendous decision, such as no one before or since was ever asked to make, but Mary was a true Confessor. Even the Calvary of Her Son looming in the distance did not shake Her confidence. Hers was the supreme confession of faith in all the world -  \"Behold the Handmaid of the Lord; be it done to Me according to thy word.\" There was the real beginning of all confessions of faith in Christ, the raising of the standard which all Martyrs and Confessors and Virgins were thenceforth to follow. There was agony entailed by Her confession of faith. The doubt, or rather reverence, which determined St. Joseph to put Her away was an almost unendurable pain. We think little of that moment of martyrdom, but it was not the least of the pains which association in the Redemption caused Her.</p><p>The glorious canonization of Mary's faith in those first days of the Incarnation came with Her confession of faith in the outbursts of the Magnificat. \"He has regarded the humility of His Handmaid... He Who is mighty has done great things to Me and Holy is His Name... His mercy is from generation unto generation to those who fear Him... He has given help to Israel, His servant.\" Every word of that inspired poem seals Mary as Queen of Confessors.</p><p>It was to be a confession of faith repeated over and over. When She brought Him forth on Christmas night and laid Him in the manger, Her eyes were the first of any creature to flood adoration upon Him. It was the first profession of faith in His Divinity, the Creed of Bethlehem, so to speak. When the shepherds came to adore Him, it was Her hands that drew the straw away that they might see \"this Word that is come to pass.\" Again, it was a manifestation of Her faith.</p><p>It was Her hands that placed in the arms of old Simeon in the temple the \"Salvation\" from God. It was in the light of faith that glowed in Her eyes, the confession of faith, that Simeon made his confession in the \"Light to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.\" Mary, the Morning-Star, brought light wherever She went. The stars left their courses to follow Her. When the light of the star showed the Wise Men the Divine Object of their quest, it was in the arms of His Mother that they found Him. She was the instrument for the manifestation of God. Jesus was not to be found save in the arms of Mary. He could not be found unless She showed Him forth. Where is Christ, the Magi and others might ask, and only Mary could vouch for Him in Her confession of faith - \"This is He, this is the Christ, this is the Son of God.\" An exile in Egypt on account of Her profession of faith in Jesus, and exile in Nazareth - for evidently the Holy Family had intended to return to Judea - hiding the Child for fear of Herod. Every decision of those days was motivated by Her faith, Her profession to the world that Her Son was the Son of God.</p><p>The miracle at Cana, where water was changed into wine, was the first miracle wrought by Jesus. For that reason it is of tremendous importance. But Mary's importance in it has always been recognized. The miracle was done at Her suggestion. It was before all the wedding guests - the confession of Her faith in His power, in His Divinity. It was so later on, when Jesus paid His tribute to Her steadfastness in the faith - \"Blessed are they who hear the Word of God and keep it.\" That was His declaration of Her eminence as Queen of Confessors.</p><p>Stabat MaterCalvary, however, was the real pulpit of Her confession of faith. The darkness had descended, the Apostles, all but John, had run away, all the world had abandoned its Creator. Mary was being martyred, but still She stood by the Cross. She who later was to destroy all heresies, even now professed Her loyalty to Jesus, Her belief in the fundamental truth that this Her Son was the Son of God. One might pursue this thought further, and consider Her faith in the Resurrection and the subsequent mysteries, Her part in strengthening the faith of the Apostles and all the other members of the infant Church. Before them all, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, She stood as the great beacon-light of faith. With a supremacy of holiness, She had a supremacy of faith. She was, and is always, the Queen of Confessors.</p><p>In Herself She was the greatest of all professors of the faith, hence Queen; but She also has that title from the fact that all Confessors of the Faith regard Her as their model, their inspiration, truly their Queen. To go into that thoroughly, would necessitate a meditation on every Saint in the calendar. In the Benedictine Abbey of Solesmes there are sculptured four busts - of St. Bernard, St. Peter Damian, St. Anselm, and St. Bonaventure, as the four Doctors of the Church who did most to write Her praises (they predate the time of St. Alphonsus Maria Liguori). But the number of those who have drawn from Her the inspiration to be great Confessors of the Faith is legion.</p><p>The Magnificat has made Her Queen of Poets. What a vacuum would be left if the poetry, the painting, the architecture, the spiritual books, the theological works, all inspired by Her as the great Confessor of the Divinity of Jesus Christ, were eliminated from the world. Our whole civilization, its beauty, its gentleness, is bound up with Her. She is not only Queen of Ireland, that beautiful title which Pope Pius XI gave Her at the Eucharistic Congress in 1932, but at one time or another She has been crowned Queen of every land under the sun - an inspiration to all peoples to confess the Faith that She confessed.</p><p>She is our inspiration, too. Our faith in Jesus is firmer because of Mary. We have kept Jesus because we have kept Mary, since it is She who has destroyed all heresies in the world. We, by the grace of God, are confessors because we are the loyal subjects of the Queen of Confessors.</p>"

    "Queen of families": {
        "eng": "<p>\"The Holy Family is the beginning of countless other holy families,\" said Pope John Paul II.  In 1995, he gave Our Lady the title \"Queen of Families,\" so we should feel comfortable asking for her help with all the cares and concerns of family life.  On today's Feast of the Holy Family, we can ask with special intensity, \"Mary, Queen of Families, pray for us!\"</p><p>We can also ask ourselves how the Holy Family can inspire us to be better husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters.  Instead of wondering What Would Jesus Do, try thinking about What Would the Holy Family do.  St. Joseph may be the first place to start.  Jesus was divine, and his mother was sinless, but St. Joseph was an ordinary human being like the rest of us.  How do you think he treated his wife and his son?  How did he lead and protect them in spite of his ordinariness?</p><p>Imagine what it would feel like if the Holy Family invited you to their house for dinner.  Picture the table, the food, the expressions on their faces.  Maybe Mary made an excellent meal, or maybe she enjoyed a good laugh at her own expense if she became lost in prayer and overcooked the meat.   Maybe the conversation centered on God and the Scriptures, or maybe on what had happened in the village that day.  Maybe what the Holy Family most wanted was to listen to you and get to know you.  People who met John Paul II frequently noticed that the pope treated them, for those few minutes, like the only person in the world.  Isn't it possible the Holy Family would do the same?  How would that make you feel?  And how would your family feel if you paid that kind of focussed attention to them?  Let these thoughts lead you into prayer, and then back into the world with the resolution to make your family life a little holier, a little more like theirs.</p>"

    "Queen of Heaven": {
        "eng": "<p>The idea of the coronation of Mary in Heaven after her Assumption took its rise in an accommodation of the words in the Song of Songs (4:8),</p><p>\"Come, my bride, from Lebanon..thou shalt be crowned..,\" and was chiefly developed and popularized by iconography.</p><p>The earliest existing example is probably the mosaic in Santa Maria in Trastevere at Rome, where Our Lady is depicted already crowned, sitting at the right hand of her Son; this dates from about 1140. A century later there appeared what became the usual design, Christ putting a crown upon His Mother's head.</p><p>The theme of the coronation of Mary was popular in English medieval carving, and it was everywhere highly embroidered and developed at the Renaissance. Among more recent artists the subject has aroused little interest, and Catholics today are familiar with it chiefly from the last glorious mystery of the rosary.</p><p>Its meaning suggests the final \"moment\" of the Assumption and the reference in the Apocalypse to \"a crown of twelve stars.\" It seems to be a second feast of the Assumption, emphasizing the bodily aspect of the mystery.</p>"
    },
    "Queen of Martyrs": {
        "eng": "<p>The Church has crowned Mary, not only with a crown of twelve stars but also with a crown of thorns, in calling Her Martyr - indeed, the Queen of Martyrs. Thus in the Vespers Hymn for the Feast of the Seven Dolors, She sings, \"The Virgin stands there the while, more noble than the martyrs: by a new wonder, O Mary, dying, Thou dost not die, though transfixed by such great and dreadful sorrows.\" And in the Communion Verse for the Mass of the Feast, She declares, \"Happy the senses of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which without death obtained the palm of martyrdom beside the Cross of the Savior.\" All the spiritual writers say the same. St. Bernard, who calls Her \"more than martyr,\" is typical of them all.</p><p>The pure body of Our Lady was exempt from physical macerations. By Her Immaculate Conception She was free from bodily ills. When She died it was not from sickness or physical disintegration, the result of original sin, but from love. Somehow we shrink from the very thought of seeing that holy body of Hers mangled in any way. It was to be all fair from the beginning and throughout eternity.</p><p>But there is a martyrdom besides that of the body; it is the martyrdom of the soul. We know that by our own experience. We have ceased to feel bodily pain at times when an overwhelming grief has rushed upon our heart. The death of dear ones, disgrace, disappointment, reverses, worries, so pierce our heart with pain, that we ignore the wounds or sickness that would otherwise lay us low physically. It is easier to bear the cut of the sword than dishonor. A broken heart is not as easily mended as a maimed body. And if we are subject to this martyrdom of soul, we can easily understand how fittingly the title martyr is given to Our Lady, who endured suffering more than sufficient to cause Her death, had not God saved Her from the physical consequence of that agony. She was willing to shed Her blood. God spared Her that, but He did not free Her from martyrdom.</p><p>Holy InnocentsOne could not be a friend of Jesus without coming into the circle of pain. As Fr. Faber says, \"The law of the Incarnation is a law of suffering.\" Jesus was the Man of Sorrows. \"Despised and the most abject of men, a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with infirmity: and His look was as it were hidden and despised, whereupon we esteemed Him not. Surely He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows: and we have thought Him as it were a leper, and as one struck by God and afflicted\" (Isaias 53: 3-4). He was the Martyr of Martyrs, the King of Martyrs, and no one could be an attendant at His throne but a lover of pain, a carrier of the Cross. To merely human eyes it seems a poor reward for loyalty, but as Christ wanted all His followers to be as nearly like Himself as possible, He compelled them to take their full course in the School of Pain. Even His little manger-crib was shaded with palms of martyrdom. The Holy Innocents before they learned to play, learned to suffer. They, as it were, mapped out with their blood the path He was to take - little prophets of the Passion. His inner circle, the Apostles, were vowed by Him to pain. At first they did not relish the idea any more than the rest of us. They ran for their lives. They hid themselves when they thought the law would pursue them, as it had destroyed Him. But, filled with the Holy Ghost, they knew there was no other way to be loyal to Him than to be nailed to His Cross. The history of the Apostles is a paradox. They conquered, but they were slaughtered, every one of them. Even St. John, who had what we call a natural death, was a martyr, not only a martyr in soul, but a martyr in body, inasmuch as being thrown into the caldron of boiling oil he suffered pain sufficient to cause death, had not God saved him by a miracle.</p><p>False religions have been established on the promise of physical delights, on the premise that bodily pain can be imagined out of existence. The Christian religion alone is the tree that sprouts and grows from the seed of pain, watered by blood. \"The blood of martyrs is the seed of Christians.\"</p><p>If that is true of others, it is especially true of Our Lady. Not enough is made of the thought of the influence of Her sanctity, Her prayers, Her sufferings, on the growth of the Church. She cooperated in the Redemption, not only in preparing Her Son for the Sacrifice, but in associating Her life with His. That association was effected first of all by Her sanctity, and then by Her martyrdom, which was indeed, the outgrowth of Her sanctity, Her will to be conformed in all things to His will. To conform to Him, She had to suffer. She knew what She was taking upon Herself when She consented to become the Mother of God. God did not trap Her. Mary knew the Scriptures, knew the Prophecy of Isaias about the Man of Sorrows. God clarified that to Her, so that She foresaw all the pain which association in the most intimate way with the suffering Christ would entail upon Her. In the moment of Her consent She became the Queen of Martyrs. St. Gabriel brought a sword sheathed in the Annunciation lily.</p><p>Thus from the beginning Mary was vowed to a life of martyrdom. Some even go further and say that, with the infused knowledge which She had at the first moment of Her existence, She foresaw all that She would be called upon to endure, and hence was a martyr even then. But Her actual martyrdom - it was a long, slow process - began on the Annunciation. St. Gabriel had left the sword behind him. Over the day of the Annunciation was the shadow of Good Friday. But before Good Friday would come there were a thousand pains to be endured, pains of fear for the life of Her Child, pains over the sins of men, which were the cause of the terrible woes He must endure. To get at the real heart of Mary's life, you must appreciate Her hatred of sin. She, the sinless one, knew that all the pain She was enduring, and would endure, was part of the fight for the conquest of evil, and for that reason She was glad to welcome any suffering Her Son would ask Her to bear.</p><p>The supremacy of Mary's sorrow came, of course, on Calvary, but that is not to minimize the pains that preceded it. It is rather surprising at first sight to discover that of the Seven Dolors which the Church chooses for Her dedication as Queen of Martyrs, three of them are concerned with the consideration of sorrows which belong to the infancy and boyhood of Jesus. But on second view you behold how these woes are part of the pattern. Her entire Motherhood was woven out of pain. Once She said to St. Bridget of Sweden - \"My whole life was spent in sorrow and tears; for My sorrow, which was compassion for My beloved Son, never departed from before My eyes. I always foresaw the sufferings and death which He was one day to endure.\" The revelations of St. Bridget ring true. They are in accordance with what Scripture reveals. Mary's Motherhood was not confined to the hours of the Passion, but was truly a part of the life of Jesus for all His thirty-three years - indeed, will be a part of His life for all eternity.</p><p>PietaNo sooner did She hold Him in Her arms than She had to accept the sword of sorrow. Simeon, with his prophecy, thrust his two-edged sword mercilessly; Herod, with his threats on the life of the Child and with the forced flight into Egypt, thrust his sword exultingly; and in the three days' loss She suffered a pain the deepest of all because it was the Hand of Love that forged the sword. Only seven sorrows are specified, the greatest ones, but you will see countless others dominating every day, every hour of Her life. But these sorrows up to the time of the Passion were but Her apprenticeship. The true accolade of martyrdom was given to Her when the King of Martyrs took His crown and His throne. Pain did its best to crowd all it could into those few hours. It was a planned tragedy of pain, act by act leading to the culmination. It was not enough for the Mother to be compelled to meet Her Son on the way to execution. That is one of the most excruciating agonies of Mary, to see Him bruised and beaten and bloody, needing Her so, yet unable to go to Him and comfort Him. The eyes of Jesus alone touched Her, but they flashed a sword that buried itself in Her Heart. Now the swords leapt from a million scabbards until one great sword, the hilted sword of the Cross, dug into Her Heart and cut it in twain. It was still there when She held His lifeless body in Her arms, that new sword of desolation, still there when She laid Him in the tomb, that sword of abandonment. Ever the sword of the Cross till the very day of Her Assumption. It was a long martyrdom, and an intense martyrdom. \"To what shall I compare Thee,\" says the Church, applying to Her the Lamentations of Jeremias (2: 13), \"or to what shall I liken Thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I equal Thee, that I may comfort Thee, O virgin daughter of Sion? For great as the sea is Thy destruction: who shall heal Thee?\" This is not mere sentimentality. The saints are not sentimentalists, they are men of hard fact, men who have suffered, men who have attained to the foot of the Cross, dragging their own cross behind them. And if there is one thing that is common to the meditations of these graduates of the School of Pain, it is the realization of the illimitable immensity of the suffering of the Mother of God. Their findings are all summed up in the pronouncement of St. Bernardine of Siena, that, \"if Her pain was subdivided and parceled among all creatures, they would perish instantly.\"</p><p>We shudder today as we read of the sufferings of the martyrs of the early ages, of Ss. Lucy and Agnes and Agatha, of those flayed alive, the human torches, the beast-devoured, the racked, the torn, the mutilated; of the martyrs of the Elizabethan persecutions; of the poor starved Irish martyrs who in Penal days called Our Lady, \"Queen of the Poor;\" they had good right to claim Her as their own in calling Her \"Queen of Martyrs.\" Martyrs all, martyrs in every age, every land, but little martyrs by the side of Her, for as St. Anselm says, \"Whatever cruelty was exercised upon the bodies of martyrs was light, nothing, compared to Her passion.\"</p><p>But if Mary is proposed to us as \"Queen of Martyrs,\" it is not just for sentimental, ineffectual condolence. We grieve for Her, it is true, but that grief will get us nowhere unless it is a practical one. Her grief was over sin and what sin caused, and we bring Her more consolation when we refrain from one venial sin than if we shed buckets of sympathetic tears for Her sorrows. Mary was martyred, and She was martyred for us. And there is another practical reason why She is set forth for us as \"Queen of Martyrs.\" It is that She is a model in the endurance of pain for the love of God. We all must be martyrs more or less. We shrink from pain. We do not crave martyrdom. We are not like William Doyle, who as a novice wrote: \"Dear Mother Mary, in preparation for the glorious martyrdom which I feel assured Thou art going to obtain for me, I, Thy most unworthy child, on this first day of the month, solemnly commence my life of slow martyrdom by earnest hard work and constant self-denial. With my blood I promise Thee to keep this resolution. Do Thou, sweet Mother, assist me and obtain for me the one favor I wish and long for - to die a Jesuit martyr.\" He got his wish at last.</p><p>And eventually we, too, will in spite of ourselves be lesser martyrs. We cannot escape the Cross. There is one being planned for us, and before we close our eyes in death it will be laid at our feet for us to pick up and carry.</p><p>It is good to get used to the idea, and in preparation for that unavoidable day, to make a friend of Her who will tell us how to carry our cross, who can show us the way after Her Divine Son, the way She followed so closely, that placed Her on Her throne as Queen of Martyrs.</p>"

    "Queen of the Most Holy Rosary": {
        "eng": "<p>There is not a true Pope in the last five hundred years who has not urged devotion to the Rosary, and enriched its recitation with Indulgences. From Pope Sixtus IV, in 1479, down to Pope Pius XII, it is one long urging of the Rosary. It was to the aspiration, \"Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, pray for us!\" that Pope Benedict XV, on October 1, 1915, during the First World War, granted an Indulgence of one hundred days. The prayer to Our Lady of the Rosary, to which St. Pius X granted an Indulgence of three hundred days, is one of the loveliest we have:</p><p>O Virgin Mary, grant that the recitation of Thy Rosary may be for me each day, in the midst of my manifold duties, a bond of unity in my actions, a tribute of filial piety, a sweet refreshment, an encouragement to walk joyfully along the path of duty. Grant, above all, O Virgin Mary, that the consideration of Thy fifteen Mysteries may form in my soul, little by little, a luminous atmosphere, pure, strengthening and fragrant, which will permeate my understanding, my will, my heart, my memory, my imagination, my whole being. So shall I acquire the habit of praying while I work, without the aid of formal prayers, by interior acts of admiration and of supplication, or by aspirations of love. I ask this of Thee, O Queen of the Holy Rosary, through St. Dominic, Thy son of predilection, the renowned preacher of Thy Mysteries, and the faithful imitator of Thy virtues. Amen.</p><p>No devout Catholic doubts the tradition of the establishment of the Rosary, as we now have it, by Our Lady through Her instrument, St. Dominic. And no one will presume to rob his spiritual sons and daughters of the glory of having manifested it to the world. They too were the instruments Our Lady used for binding about the world the rose garland of Her love. They inherited the spirit of St. Dominic, his love for Mary and his confidence in Her aid. One of the traits of St. Catherine of Siena was her love of flowers. While walking in the garden she would gather flowers and bind them together in the form of a cross and send them by her foster-brother Father Thomas, a Dominican, to her friends. We are sure a prayer was breathed into every flower. Gathering her roses, she drew a spiritual lesson - \"From the thorns of tribulation let us pluck the rose of peace and quiet.\"</p><p>There is no name, however, that has as much right to be associated with the Rosary as that of Pope Leo XIII. It is due to him that we have this title, \"Queen of the Most Holy Rosary,\" in our Litany. Not that he discovered it. As far back as 1614 it was inserted by the Dominicans in the Litany used by their Order, and in 1675 it was permitted to the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary. But Leo XIII made it universal. On September 1, 1883, he issued an Encyclical wherein he declared that the Rosary was the great means of prayer against the evils of his day, and he ordered it to be said publicly every day in Rome. A few months later, December 10, he ordered the invocation, \"Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, pray for us!\" to be inserted in the Litany of Loreto for the Universal Church. That same month he expressed his desire in a Brief that the Rosary be recited every day in Cathedrals, and on Sundays and holy days of obligation in all parish churches. Finally, in 1885, he established Rosary Month - October - to be continued till the peace and liberty of the Church be restored. And, in 1887, he raised the Feast of the Most Holy Rosary to a Double of the Second Class. The numerous writings of Pope Leo XIII on the Holy Rosary are timely reading today - and will always be timely - for they insist on what will always be timely - devotion to Our Lady in Her queen of devotions, the Rosary.</p><p>There is one passage from his writings that sums up the whole meaning of the Rosary:</p><p>May the Christian nations cling more and more to the practice of the Rosary, to which our ancestors had recourse as an every-ready refuge in misfortune, and as a glorious pledge and proof of Christian faith and devotion. We have desired, and desired nothing more ardently, than that the fervor of the faithful in performing the devotion of the Rosary should not languish, but should remain firm. The Holy Father desires to increase devotion toward the Mother of God, particularly by this form of prayer which is most pleasing to Her. Amongst the various forms of prayer used in the Church piously and well, the Rosary has many titles of praise - especially this, that it was instituted to implore the help of the Mother of God against the enemies of the Faith; and, as all know, it has frequently consoled the Church in trial. Not only, therefore, is it proper for private prayer, but also for public occasions. This form of prayer should be restored to the honor it long held, when every Christian family marked each day with its recital. Hence We exhort and beseech all to say the Rosary every day with constancy. Care must be taken that, in these sad times for the Church, the holy custom of reciting the Rosary be carefully observed, especially as this form of prayer is excellently suited to nourish the spirit of devotion.Ever since the victory at Lepanto, October 7, 1571, Our Lady of the Rosary has been the war-cry of Christian civilization. Catholics were in terror. It looked as if they were to be destroyed from the face of the earth by the Turks, who were sweeping all before them. By the grace of God, there was a great Saint at the head of the Church, St. Pius V, who had unbounded faith in the help of the Mother of God. He fasted and prayed, got his people to fast and pray. The fight of the Catholic forces was against all odds, but what could the enemies of God do when they were facing Her, who is \"terrible as an army set in battle array\"? She won the victory, as the Confraternities of the Rosary were holding their processions in supplication to Her. The Rosary won. \"By the Rosary,\" said St. Pius, \"the darkness of heresy has been dispelled, and the light of the Catholic Faith shines out in all its brilliancy.\"</p><p>Vivat Hispania! Domino Gloria!Don Juan of Austria has set his people free!</p><p>Chesterton tells the story in his magnificent poem \"Lepanto,\" but we wish he had paid tribute to what Mary had contributed to the might of Don Juan of Austria. The victory of Lepanto is but another comment on the words addressed by the Church to Her - \"Thou alone hast destroyed all the heresies in the whole world.\"</p><p>Lourdes WindowI like to think that when Pope Leo was urging the daily recitation of the Rosary, he was somehow thinking of the example of the Irish (the author is Irish). Father Tom Burke says somewhere that it was the Rosary which kept the Faith in the Irish people. The Rosary was part and parcel of the Irish. During the horrible Penal days, when the Irish Catholics were driven into caves to worship God, the Rosary was the golden chain that bound them together as the Church militant. The worshippers in the Catacombs had not known greater trial. They faced martyrdom confidently, with their hands in the hands of Mary. They went into battle with the beads about their neck. They had been initiated into a love for the Rosary by starvation and pain. It became the sign of their Faith, as they continued to wear it so in the face of their anti-Catholic neighbors, who hated everything Catholic, but the Rosary most of all.</p><p>But the love for the Rosary is not only a mark of the Irish Catholic. Say Catholic and you say Rosary. It is the garden of the world where every Catholic delights to walk and breathe in the fragrance of Mary's presence, from the little child to the mighty Doctor of Theology. The greater the Saint, the greater his love for the Rosary. It is in the Rosary that Mary speaks a universal language. As someone has said, it is \"the most complete expression of Christian piety.\"</p><p>The Rosary has a special meaning for us today. We have not yet begun to appreciate to the full the definition of the Immaculate Conception. It has clarified Mariology beyond the greatest hopes of the theologians of past ages. Nor have we begun yet to appreciate to the full the apparitions of Our Lady at Lourdes. Lourdes was a second proclamation of the Immaculate Conception. When St. Bernadette asked the Vision Her name, She replied, \"I am the Immaculate Conception.\" But there is another point to the apparition that is not made as much of as it should be. It is in regard to the Rosary. When St. Bernadette saw the beautiful Lady, instinctively she took her Rosary in her hands and went on her knees. \"The Lady,\" said Bernadette, \"made with Her head a sign of approval and Herself took into Her hands a Rosary which hung on Her right arm. When I attempted to begin the Rosary and tried to lift my hand to my forehead, my arm remained paralyzed, and it was only after the Lady had signed Herself that I could do the same. The Lady let me pray alone; She passed the beads of Her Rosary between Her fingers, but She said nothing; only at the end of each decade did She say the Gloria with me.\" It is all so theologically correct. No mere child could have invented such a story. Mary could not pray for daily bread, or for forgiveness of trespasses, nor could She pray to Herself in the Hail Mary, but She could sing to the Holy Trinity the song of the Gloria Patri. Lourdes was a new proclamation of the Rosary, a declaration of Our Lady that the Rosary was dear to Her and that She wished to be identified with it.</p><p>It is a new inspiration to us. We love the Rosary. It is the rope-ladder to Heaven. It is the chain of love, holding us fast to the hands of the Queen of Heaven. Some day when we are leaving the world with empty hands, the only thing that we will want to carry is a handful of beads, hoping that back in Her garden every one of them will be glorified into a fragrant rose, for us, Her little ones, to lay at Her feet.</p>"

    "Queen of Patriarchs": {
        "eng": "<p>Queen of Patriarchs, pray for us! Most people repeat this prayer without giving much thought to it. They feel so far removed from Patriarchal days that the title has little significance to them. But it is full of meaning as applied to Our Lady and must be one of the most pleasing to Her of all the titles of Her Litany. For it glorifies Her as Queen of Her own chosen people, the culmination of that long line of believing men and women who through joy and tribulation, prosperity and failure, held fast to the promise of God. If we have Mary, it is, humanly speaking, because of the Patriarchs.</p><p>Patriarch, a Greek word meaning the Head or Prince of a tribe, may be commonly applied to those noted characters whose lives are recorded in the Bible before Moses; so that the great Patriarchs are Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The twelve sons of Jacob also are called patriarchs (Acts 7: 8,9) and even King David is called a patriarch (Acts 2: 29). The patriarchal system was but a development of the family. It was the family grown into a tribe, so common to the history of every people. In a word, it was one big family based on the sacredness of family ties, with the father as the head. We have a great example of it in the strong tribal bond of the Irish. The old saying - \"Blood is thicker than water\" - is a tribal slogan, a tribute to the fundamental importance of the family. The Patriarchs constituted God's special family, His chosen family, and as such were a type of the Holy Family which could trace its lineage back to Patriarchal days.</p><p>The great ancestor was Abraham. Mary was proud of him. She was Jewish, glorying in the loyalty of Her people to God, and knowing that the Incarnation was come because the blood that coursed through Her veins had come in a clear, unpolluted stream from the father Abraham.</p><p>Abraham throws a strong light on Mary, and Mary throws a strong light on Abraham. She was a true descendant of his, and She was glad to acknowledge it. In the Magnificat She associates Herself with Abraham as recipient of the Divine promises - \"He that is mighty had done great things to Me - as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.\"</p><p>Abraham was a great hero to the Jews. No wonder he was one of God's noblemen. God had chosen him from among all men to be the founder of His chosen people, and had brought him into the land of Chanaan where he erected altars to the Lord. Abraham is the starting point of the religion of the Old Testament. From that time on God is spoken of as \"the God of Abraham.\" We are not going to detail the history of Abraham. One could spend much time in finding in it many types of Our Lady, such as his flight into Egypt; his meeting with Melchisedec, the King of Salem, to whom he gives tithes of all he has; the promise of God to Abraham that his seed would be as the stars of Heaven - \"Look up to Heaven and number the stars if thou canst. And He said to him: So shall thy seed be\" (Gen. 15: 5). Number the stars! Our Lady, too, numbered them - \"All generations shall call me blessed.\" And the inspired writer says - \"Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice\" (Gen. 15: 6). So the similarity continues. Abraham entertains God and two angels; a son is sent miraculously to Abraham and the child is circumcised on the eighth day. Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isaac. He was willing to obey God. He had the sword in his hand ready to strike, when an angel of the Lord stayed his hand, saying - \"now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for My sake\" (Gen. 22: 12). Only, with Mary, the only-begotten Son was not spared.</p><p>Many a time during the Passion, Mary who knew the Scriptures well, must have thought of Abraham's trust in God and his willingness to sacrifice his son at God's command. She was the true daughter of Abraham. Abraham believed God; so did Mary: Abraham trusted God; so did Mary: Abraham obeyed God; so did Mary.</p><p>As God said to him after his willingness to sacrifice his son: \"Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only-begotten son for My sake, I will bless, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of Heaven, and as the sand that is by the seashore: thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed My voice\" (Gen. 22: 16-18).</p><p>In these, and other words oft repeated, Abraham is singled out as the head of a chosen generation, a new people of God, just as his descendant Mary is later singled out as the head of a new generation, the Woman to crush the head of the serpent - not only the Mother of a chosen people, but the very Mother of God.</p><p>So the Evangelists are careful to trace back the line of this Mother of God to Abraham and the promises given him for the blessing of Israel, as Mary said in the Magnificat, and as Zachary said in the Benedictus - \"The oath which He swore to Abraham our father.\"</p><p>All through the New Testament tremendous importance is attached to the promises God made to Abraham. All the Jews gloried in being the seed of Abraham. St. Paul thrills at the thought that he is a child of Abraham, not by seed alone, but more, in the faith to which, by the grace of God, descent from Abraham has brought him.</p><p>The whole lesson of Abraham to the Jews, to the Apostles and Evangelists and to the Church, was that he believed God, and so began to clear the way for the New Dispensation. The Church has always loved Abraham. There are innumerable references to him in the prayers of the Liturgy. The \"Bosom of Abraham,\" which means Heaven and eternal bliss, is one of the loveliest expressions we have. It is one of the dearest hopes we have who though not of the carnal seed of Abraham have been admitted to the new chosen people by faith. \"Amen, I say to you, I have not found so great faith in Israel. And I say to you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven.\"</p><p>Isaac, though inferior in character to his father Abraham, was a friend of God, a simple gentleman, worthy to hand on the promises made to the chosen people. The blessing he gave to his son Jacob can be fittingly applied to his descendant Mary. \"God give thee the dew of Heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and wine. And let people serve thee, and tribes worship thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and let thy Mother's children bow down before thee. Cursed be he that curseth thee: and let him that blesseth thee be filled with blessings\" (Gen. 27: 28-29).</p><p>Mary must have loved the gentle, peaceful Isaac, willing to be sacrificed at the will of God. Was he not a figure of her own Son, the Prince of Peace, Who purchased peace for the world by His Sacrifice on Mount Calvary? She was proud to be a daughter of Isaac.</p><p>We have made reference elsewhere to the vision granted to Jacob, the \"Jacob's ladder\" which has given to Mary the title \"Ladder of Heaven,\" with the angels ascending and descending. Fittingly applied to Her are the words of God's promise to Jacob - \"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and thy seed all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed\" (Gen. 28, 14).</p><p>So runs along through the ages the line of Patriarchs, which may be called the River of God's promise. Down through the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve tribes, down through David's line till it comes to Mary, who is the fulfillment of God's original promise, to crush the head of the serpent.</p><p>To us who have seen the fulfillment of the prophecies, who no longer rest in figures but in facts, these venerable characters of the Old Testament promises are apt to be a bit vague. But they were vital to the Jews. They were their national heroes. They were the clear proof of the claim that the Jews were the chosen people. There were many souls in Israel who were proud to be the children of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, souls like St. Joseph, St. Zachary, St. Elizabeth and many others, who recognized the Messias when He came. But most of all Mary. Her mind was saturated with the memories of these ancient blessings to Her people. The faith of the Patriarchs, trusting in the plain word of God, was a joy to Her heart. She knew all that was meant by their loyalty, by their preservation of the Faith. The outstanding quality in any saint is faith. What of the faith of Mary who had a supremacy of sanctity? It is Her faith that connects Her with the line of Patriarchs, not merely Her descent in the flesh. Surely on Assumption Day, when She entered Heaven, after adoring the Triune God, and then greeting Her Son and Ss. Joseph, Joachim and Anne, the first ones She sought out in that \"Bosom of Abraham\" were Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and Heaven's happiness was increased for them as they beheld their loveliest Daughter, now the Queen of Patriarchs.</p>"

    "Queen of Peace": {
        "eng": "<p>There is a Mass of Our Lady Queen of Peace, also known as the Feast of the Prodigies of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We are told by scholars that the word Ave, Hail, means \"peace (or joy) to thee,\" so that every time we salute Her in the words of St. Gabriel we proclaim Her the peaceful One, She who is full of grace - and are they not both the same? Peace! That is the constant prayer of the Church. Lamb of God, grant us peace! is the daily prayer in the Mass. Peace and true concord, peace and unity, is the earnest prayer in the Litany of the Saints. May they rest in peace! is the prayer repeated so many times a day for the poor souls. In the Mass of the Blessed Virgin for Easter time the Church sings - \"The rod of Jesse hath blossomed: a virgin hath brought forth God and Man: God hath restored peace, reconciling in Himself the lowest and the highest.\"</p><p>The loveliest name of the Messias to come was \"the Prince of Peace,\" as given in the Prophet Isaias (9: 6), \"a Child is born to us, and His name shall be called\u2026 the Prince of Peace.\" It is an unforgettable picture which Isaias paints of the spiritual Kingdom of Christ - \"The wolf shall dwell with the lamb; and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; the calf and lion, and the sheep shall abide together, and a little Child shall lead them\" (Is. 11: 6). When Jesus was born the world was at peace. It was His will to have things that way, to show that He was the bringer of peace and reconciliation. The first song heard about His crib was the angelic message of peace, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.\" He lived in peace at Nazareth for the many years of His hidden life. When at the beginning of His public life He declared the Constitution of the New Kingdom in the Beatitudes, He insisted on peace as an essential. \"Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God\" (Matt. 5: 9). It was the essence of His Last Will and Testament. \"Peace I leave with you. My peace I give unto you\" (John 14: 27). His death on Calvary was the confirmation of peace to man, a lasting peace dearly purchased by His Precious Blood. And after the Resurrection His constant greeting was - \"Peace be to you: it is I, fear not\" (Luke 24: 36). The Prince of Peace at the beginning, the Prince of Peace at the end, the Prince of Peace for all eternity.</p><p>Regina PacisIt is a striking thing, how often peace is spoken of in the Epistles; yet, not strange, for the whole theme of the preaching of the Apostles is the Redemption, the reconciliation of man with God. The Son of God became man to bring peace and rest to sinful man. That is the whole purpose of our life, to rest in God. \"Thou hast made us for Thyself, O God,\" says St. Augustine, \"and our hearts shall never have rest until they rest in Thee.\"</p><p>There was no one whose life was modelled after that of Jesus as much as was Our Lady's. Being the cooperator with Him in our Redemption, She must be as like Him as possible. She was never at war with God, as the rest of men. From the very first moment of Her existence She was, by Her Immaculate Conception, preserved from sin, which is the only thing that can rob the soul of peace. She was the \"garden enclosed,\" where the tumult of the world could never enter; She was the fair, chaste moon riding serene in the heavens. If there is one mark of Mary's sanctity, it is Her serenity of soul. She breathed forth peace like the flowers in Her garden. It was not a false Nirvana-like peace. It was a militant peace, as became Her who was \"terrible as an army set in battle-array.\" Mothers never know inactivity, never have idle hands - the Mother of God least of all. For thirty-three years She took care of Jesus. That needed fortitude, in facing the enemies of His infancy, but especially in standing on Calvary to bear testimony to the world. Sorrows bore down in legions upon Her, but they could never harm Her peace of soul, for She was the Mother of the Prince of Peace; She was the Spouse of the Holy Ghost, Whose fruit in the soul is essentially Peace.</p><p>Mary had Her work to do on earth in helping to establish the Kingdom of Peace. God willed that the Incarnation depended on Her free consent. But Her work is not finished by Her Assumption into Heaven. She was not relegated to a seat of bliss, however glorious. Mothers never sit idle. When the Little Flower was asked by one of her companions in Carmel to look down upon them when she got to Heaven, her prophetic reply was, \"I will not look down, I will come down.\" One of the authentic facts of World War I was her presence on the battlefields of France, bringing peace and consolation to the wounded soldiers. She is destined to spend her eternity doing good on earth.</p><p>Regina PacisIf that is so of Saints, it is, needless to say, more so of Our Lady. There are the old stock examples of Lepanto and Vienna, where She brought peace to a civilization that was threatened with annihilation. These innumerable interventions of Our Lady bearing the olive-branch would fill many a book.</p><p>Yes, important as they are to the preservation of the Kingdom of God, they are little compared with Her work in bringing peace to the individual soul. There are innumerable Saints to testify to that. Some of them had been great sinners, their souls in turmoil, until Mary laid Her quieting hand upon them, and sent them forth to suffer and die with a peace beyond understanding. The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of malice shall not touch them: in the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, but they are in peace (Wisd. 3: 1-3).</p><p>Peace through Mary! That is the prayer which the Church says on the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel - \"Most noble Queen of the world, Mary, ever Virgin, intercede for our peace and salvation.\" She who has always been the olive-branch, She who brought into the world the Prince of Peace, will not forget the world now. The Vicar of Christ knew the need of Her help when he besought us to invoke Her as Queen of Peace. She brought peace then. \"Blessed are the peacemakers;\" \"Blessed art Thou among women.\"</p><p>The world has not yet learned its lesson. We still take up the sword, forgetting that they who take up the sword shall perish by the sword. Still the words of Christ are reproaching us - \"if thou hadst known the things that are to thy peace.\" If we really want peace for the world, we will cleanse our souls of sin, which after all is the only obstacle to peace. Now and at the hour of our death, the name of Mary is the peace-bringer. \"May the Name of the Mother of God,\" prayed St. Germanus, \"be the last movement of my tongue speaking, that bearing the olive-branch of peace, I may fly away and be at peace.\" \"Holy Mary\" is the first invocation of our Litany; \"Queen of Peace\" is the last. They are both the same - \"our life, our sweetness and our hope,\" our eternal peace, in the Kingdom of Peace, with the Prince of Peace and the Queen of Peace.</p>"

    "Queen of Prophets": {
        "eng": "<p>Mary ImmaculateThe truth is not sufficiently grasped that Mary belongs to the Old Testament as well as to the New. The whole history of the Jews, the chosen people, is bound up with Her. If you read the Scriptures with that thought in mind, they become startlingly clear. The whole raison d'\u00eatre of God's setting apart the Jews from the other nations of the world was the promised Redeemer, the Messias. That was the life stream of Jewish religion, Jewish culture, Jewish patriotism. At times it was but an undercurrent, generally forgotten or ignored, but it was there nonetheless, as unobtrusive as the bloodstream, but just as necessary to existence.</p><p>The promised Messias was the central point of Jewish life, and as a necessary concomitant to the Messias was the Woman who would be His Mother. For there was to be a Woman who would be of tremendous importance to the Redemption of man. After the Fall, God declared to the evil one, \"I will put enmities between thee and the Woman, and thy seed and Her Seed: She shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for Her heel\" (Gen. 4: 15). Whether it is the Woman who will crush the head or the Woman's Seed, is an immaterial reading. The point is that a Woman was to bring forth the One Who would conquer Satan and redeem man. You must realize that the Jews understood all that quite as well as we, in fact better, because their whole system was build upon it. That \"Woman\" was a certainty. They did not know what name She would bear, other than the promised Woman. They did not know when She would come. But She would come in God's good time. There was nothing hazy about Her. She was an actual promise, the Woman of hope, who would henceforth be a dominant factor in the history of the world. There are many titles in our Litany which may well have been thought of in the early days of the expectation of the \"Woman\" - \"Mother of Christ, or Messias,\" \"Cause of Our Joy,\" \"Vessel of Honor\" and so on, for the Woman who would bring forth the Messias would be all these things.</p><p>So that in that first prophecy at the Gate of the Garden of Eden, Mary is by right of title just as much the Queen-Mother, the Queen of Prophets, as in the fulfillment thousands of years later when She was the Queen-Mother of Bethlehem. The first Prophet was God; Mary is the Mother of God. What a tremendous significance that gives to Her title, \"Queen of Prophets.\"</p><p>Years passed by, ages rolled on, the people fell away from God, most of them were destroyed, a remnant remained faithful to the promise, the ark of Noah reared above the waters, saving its treasures - and among those treasures was the vision they kept in their hearts of a star of hope, the Woman who would bring forth the Redeemer. Empires rose and fell, Abraham came to the land of Chanaan, the \"Woman\" became more definite. She was coming nearer, for God had designated the chosen people from whom She would come - to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and his seed forever.</p><p>A short time, and the prophecy narrows to one of Jacob's twelve sons, to the tribe of Juda. \"The scepter shall not be taken away from Juda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till He comes that is to be sent, and He shall be the Expectation of nations\" (Gen. 49: 10). Now could the daughters of Juda alone ask that question among themselves - which of us is the \"Woman,\" which of us is beginning the line that will produce the Woman who will be the Mother of the Christ? Nearer the Woman comes. She is to be a daughter of David, for the Lord had said to him, \"Of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne\" (Ps. 131: 11). It was no far distant ancestress of Mary who asked herself if it were possible she would be Mother of the Messias, some woman who spoke the same tongue as Mary, possibly even looked like Her. All that whole line of women down the ages had been in a sense prophetesses, since they were giving, mother to daughter, the good news of the prophecy about the Woman who would bear the Christ. They regarded that unnamed Woman as their Queen - Queen of Prophetesses.</p><p>It would take too long to consider in detail all the prophetic texts about the Messias, and consequently about the \"Woman\" who was to bear Him. Again, we must not lose sight of the \"Woman\" idea all through the thought of the Jewish people. As Cardinal Newman puts it - \"At the end of many centuries, it was further revealed to the Jews that the great Messias, or Christ... should be born of their race, and of one particular tribe... From that time every woman of the tribe hoped to have the privilege of herself being the Mother of the Messias, or Christ; for it stood to reason, since He was so great, the Mother must be great and blessed too. Hence it was, among other reasons, that they thought so highly of the married state, because, not knowing the mystery of the miraculous conception of the Christ when He was actually to come, they thought that the marriage rite was the ordinance necessary for His coming.\" That Mother to be was the Queen of all Jewish women, the most blessed of all women, so that, apart from the new inspiration of the Holy Ghost, it was no new thought for Elizabeth to call Our Lady \"Blessed among women.\"</p><p>Queen of ProphetsBut while Mary is Queen of all the Prophets, She, as Virgin Mother, is especially Queen of the Prophets Isaias and Jeremias. Isaias was the first Gabriel, glorifying the annunciation to virginity. \"Behold,\" he said to the unworthy King Achaz, \"a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and His name shall be called Emmanuel\" (Is. 7: 14). Holy man that Isaias was, he must have reverenced in that moment the Virgin of whom he was the first one to speak. Did he in the glow of prophecy visualize that maiden-mother? We feel that he did, and that he was the first to pay his homage to Her who was the Queen of Prophets, greater than all the prophets, Mother of the Prophet, Mother of the Child. \"For a Child is born to us, and a Son is given to us, and the government is upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God the Mighty, the Father of the World to Come, the Prince of Peace\" (Is. 9: 6).</p><p>And when Jeremias gave forth his prophecy - \"the Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth. A Woman shall compass a man\" (Jer. 31: 22), meaning that a Woman would bear in Her womb a grown man - he, too, beheld the \"Woman\" foretold in Genesis. He, too, undoubtedly was blessed to visualize in some way the Virgin Mary, who was to bring forth the seed to crush the serpent's head. He, too, knew Her to be his Queen, the Queen of all prophets, the Queen of the universe, as Her Son was King of the universe. It is a striking thing that all of Mary's close associates at the beginning of the Mystery of the Incarnation were filled with the prophetic spirit. Zachary, with his glorious Benedictus; Elizabeth, with her \"Whence is this to me that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?\"; John the Baptist, leaping in the womb; the shepherds and their Angel; the Magi and their star; Simeon, with his Nunc Dimittis; Anna, the prophetess: all, of course, glorified the God Whom Mary bore, but they reverenced, too, Her whose greatness and blessedness their prophetic souls discerned. They reverenced Her as their Queen.</p><p>Mary is Queen of Prophets not only because the prophets foretold Her, and in fore-telling Her reverenced Her for the great office for which She was destined - that of \"the Woman\" of the Redemption - but also because She was a prophetess Herself, the greatest of all the prophets: \"My spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior - for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\" The Magnificat proclaims Her a prophet without a peer. She fulfills prophecy as She stands at the door of Elizabeth, looking back to the \"Woman\" of Genesis who was to crush the serpent's head, and looking forward to the Apocalypse, to the Woman Clothed with the Sun, the Woman called Blessed by all generations, not only the generation of time, but the generation of eternity.</p><p>Truly then, this title, Queen of Prophets, though not made much of generally, is one of the most tremendous in the Litany, the one that as a golden thread runs all through the Scriptures from first to last. And there is one final thought about Mary the Prophet. It is that She is a prophet for us. Many times since Her Assumption She has come back to earth to give a message to mankind, to preach penance, to promise blessings. We ourselves shall never have the vision of Her till, by the grace of God, we come to Paradise, but all our lives She has been prophesying to our souls, illuminating the way, showing us how we may come to Her and Her Divine Son. Blessed are we if we heed this Queen of Prophets.</p>"

She is the summit of kindness and consideration.</p><p>Though Queen of Heaven, we have no doubt that when this earth was privileged to have her as a dweller, Mary, Our Lady Queen of May, was the most humane of human beings, even through blessed far beyond our capacity to conceive of it.</p><p>The fact that she is Queen of the Universe; still, she does not enjoy the loyalty of all and must suffer the indifference of those who do not deign to pay her homage. Above everything, she sorrows to see so many deny her Son.</p><p>Catholic devotion to Mary is found on all the virtues which human nature should and would possess, but seldom does. Mary is worthy of the admiration which men give her. Hers is a heart adorned as no other heart, with tenderness for the sinner Her Divine Son died to save; with meekness to confound the proud, with kindness toward human frailty; with love for all, because God has loved them first.</p><p>It is, however, Mary's holiness and purity that become the special object of our devotion; a purity that become the special object of our devotion; a purity of soul and body that we should revere and strive to imitate. Sin and Satan were never a part of Mary's life. Would that we could say the same! Not for a moment was there ever any difference between her will and that of the Most High. Not for a moment was there anything in Mary that could in any way displease her Lord. Of all God's creatures, Mary is indeed all fair, the beloved of the Almighty.</p><p>During this month dedicated to her, let us admire the sinlessness of God's Mother, of our own Heavenly Mother. With God's grace and Mary's assistance and intercession, we can achieve that purity of soul that is pleasing to her and to her Son. Our Lady Queen of May!</p>"

    "Queen of Virgins": {
        "eng": "<p>Mary is the Queen of Virgins, the Virgin of Virgins, because She is the greatest of Virgins.</p><p>There is a strong statement from the Council of Trent: \"If anyone assert that man, after he is once justified, is able to avoid throughout his lifetime all sin, even venial, except by a special divine privilege, as the Church holds in regard to the Blessed Virgin, let him be anathema!\" It is the statement of Her supremacy of sanctity. St. John Damascene called Her, \"a holy book, impervious to evil thoughts.\" Nothing is more eloquent than the panegyric of St. Ephrem: \"All pure, all immaculate, all stainless, all undefiled, all blameless, all worthy of praise, all incorrupt - after the Trinity, Mistress of all; after the Paraclete, another counselor; and after the Mediator, the whole world's Mediatrix; higher beyond compare than the Cherubim and Seraphim, fullness of the graces of the Trinity, holding the second place after the Godhead.\"</p><p>When the fittings of the altar for the Old Testament tabernacle were being made, it was ordered that everything in connection with the service should be most pure for the most pure God. \"Behold,\" says Job (25, 5), \"even the moon doth not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight.\" The candlestick and all the vessels were to be made of the finest gold. The olive oil was to be of the purest; pure incense; pure myrrh; and the altar was to be pure. These were but types. And Mary, who was to give Her flesh for the Incarnation of the Son of God, was to be the most pure Virgin, before His birth, in His birth, and after His birth. \"No defiled thing cometh into Her,\" says the Church in the Gradual of the Mass for the Most Pure Heart of Mary, \"for She is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted Mirror of God's majesty, and the image of His goodness\" (Wisdom 7).</p><p>Presentation of MaryWe have already discussed under the title, \"Virgin of Virgins,\" the virginity of Mary. There is nothing to be added there. But Mary is called \"Queen of Virgins\" not only because She is the greatest of all Virgins, but because She is the exemplar of virginity, and the Queen of all who have vowed themselves to the virgin life for the love of God. She is their Queen. In an apocryphal writing we are told that when Our Lady lived in the temple, the maidens called Her \"Queen of Virgins.\" It may be noted that the same source says, \"A Virgin has conceived, a Virgin has brought forth, and a Virgin She remains.\"</p><p>Christianity has glorified virginity. There were virgins under the Old Law, but as an institution it is peculiarly Christian, in imitation of Christ and His Virgin Mother. Virginity, for man or woman, is the keeping - and in vowed virginity, the determination to keep - physical integrity, from a spiritual motive, and not only a material integrity of the body but the integrity of a virgin soul, free from all lust. It is evident that no one is bound to take this vow, apart from its being a concomitant of Sacred Orders. It is a counsel of perfection. \"All men take not this word,\" said Our Lord, \"but they to whom it is given - he that can take, let him take it\" (Matt. 19: 11-12). St. Paul also counsels it - \"Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful\" (1 Cor. 7: 25). And he puts the reason in a nutshell, that the married person \"is divided,\" and so he counsels virginity, \"which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment\" (Ibid. 35).</p><p>Therefore the Church has always esteemed virginity as, in itself, preferable to the married state, since it constitutes a victory over the lower appetites, and also leaves a man freer to attend to spiritual things. The virgin life is closer to the life of the Virgin Christ, and will receive in Heaven a special glory or crown. St. John, in the Apocalypse, glorifies the one hundred and forty-four thousand virgins. \"These follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth - for they are without spot before the throne of God\" (Apoc. 14: 4-5).</p><p>The glorious canonization of Mary's faith in those first days of the Incarnation came with Her confession of faith in the outbursts of the Magnificat. \"He has regarded the humility of His Handmaid... He Who is mighty has done great things to Me and Holy is His Name... His mercy is from generation unto generation to those who fear Him... He has given help to Israel, His servant.\" Every word of that inspired poem seals Mary as Queen of Confessors.</p><p>The consecrated virgins have always been one of the glories of the Church. This consecration is evident from the beginning. Tertullian exclaims - \"How many virgins of both sexes!\" It was a noble profession. In Syria the virgins were called \"Daughters of the Covenant.\" Even girls of the tender age of ten and twelve vowed their virginity to God, though later on the age of consecration was set at twenty-five years. It was such a solemn ceremony that the Bishop presided at the clothing. The ceremony as given in the Roman Pontifical is very solemn and reserved to the Bishop during Mass. He blesses the veil, the ring, and the crown. In the early ages the consecrated virgins remained at home, engaged in prayer and labor, but after the eighth century as the convents increased, and cloister became the rule, the ceremonies of the various Orders began to replace the Pontifical ceremony. But what a tremendous ceremony it was - with prayer after prayer. How important it was, and how the Church regarded the consecrated virgin, is evident from the anathema which the Bishop pronounces against anyone who would presume to take her away from the service of God, to which she is vowed, or to rob her of her goods. \"If anyone dares to attempt this, may he be cursed in his house and out of it; may he be cursed in the city and in the country; cursed awake, cursed asleep; cursed eating, cursed drinking; cursed walking, cursed sitting; cursed be his flesh, his bones, and from the sole of his foot to the top of his head may he have no health. May there come upon him the malediction which God permitted through Moses in the Law to the sons of iniquity. May his name be wiped out from the book of life, and not written with the just; may his position and inheritance be with the fratricide Cain, with Dathin and Abiron, with Ananias and Sapphira, with Simon Magus, and Judas the Betrayer, and with those who have said to God - Depart from us, we do not choose the path of Thy ways. May he perish on the day of judgment; may perpetual fire devour him with the devil and his angels, unless he restore and return to an amendment of his life. Amen, amen. Fiat, fiat.\"</p><p>Such an anathema might seem exaggerated, until you remember that the vowed virgin was helpless in a warring, lustful world, often compelled to oppose the ambition of her parents, who could see only an advantageous marriage as the purpose in life of their daughter. Oftentimes it was otherwise good Catholics who would bitterly oppose their child entering a convent. One need only recall the family opposition to St. Clare and her sister St. Agnes, and to St. Catherine of Siena, when they sought to consecrate themselves to God. They needed all the protection of the Church.</p><p>St. Catherine of SienaBut in spite of opposition, in spite of the allurements of the world, the virgins went on consecrating themselves to God. There can be no other explanation of it but the wish to follow the example of the true model of all womanhood, the Blessed Virgin Mary. It has been one of the marvels of the world, that in every age such a multitude of girls have espoused themselves - virgin brides to the Virgin Christ. St. Brigid of Ireland was called \"the Mary of the Gael.\" So may every nun be called another Mary, as every priest is called another Christ. It is Mary who places the ring upon their finger, espousing them to the King, as she did in the mystical nuptials of St. Catherine of Siena. Thus the Church applies to Our Lady, in the Introit of the Mass of the Annunciation, the words of the Psalmist, \"All the rich among the people shall entreat thy countenance; after her shall virgins be brought to the King: her neighbors shall be brought to Thee in gladness and rejoicing\" (Ps. 44).</p><p>Mary is regarded by all virgins as their Queen, because it is Her special province to guard them. St. Ambrose says, \"In Heaven She leads the choirs of virgin souls: with Her the consecrated virgins will one day be numbered.\" In the Matins Hymn for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception She is called Praeclara custos virginum, \"the illustrious guardian of virgins.\" It is reminiscent of St. Gertrude who made this prayer - \"And now, O my Jesus, Thou one desire of my heart, I beseech Thee to commend and consign me to Thy Mother, the virginal and sovereign Rose. May She ever be, for love of Thee, the guide and the keeper of my virginity.\" And in one of her litanies she prays, \"O holy Mary, Thou Paradise of sanctity and lily of purity, be thou my guide and the shelter and defense of my chastity.\"</p><p>St. Ildephonsus, Bishop of Toledo, went to the church one night, and found Our Lady seated in the apse in his own episcopal throne, while a crowd of virgins were gathered about Her, singing Her praises. This was a significant vision. Throughout the ages, in cloisters, in hospitals, in schools, on the battlefield, at the missions, our Catholic sisters have crowded at the feet of the Queen of Virgins, praying, working, suffering, in order to make themselves dearer to Her and Her Divine Son. It is a glorious vocation, a hard life, but a blessed life. And when you think about it at the feet of Mary, the marvel is that not that so many, like Her, have chosen the better part, but rather that thousands upon thousands more of our Catholic girls have not chosen to follow in the pathway where She first walked. We need many religious vocations, not only to do the work of the Kingdom of God in the spiritual and corporal works of mercy, but by their personal sanctity to increase the practice of holiness on the earth, and help to save the souls of the rest of mankind - including lukewarm Christians. And what prayer can we make to the Queen of Virgins but this, that She raise up countless maidens for Christ, that \"after Her shall virgins be brought to the King.\"</p>"

    "Queenship of Mary": {
        "eng": "<p>Mary is Queen by grace, divine relationship, right of conquest, and singular election. Coming as a crowning event in the beautiful month of May, the Queenship of Mary, we welcome this feast with spiritual affection and experience a sense of deep interior peace as we gather in her presence to rededicate ourselves to our loving Mother and Queen. The Introit of the Mass for the day tells us: \"Let us all rejoice in the Lord as we celebrate the feast in honor of our Queen, the Blessed Virgin Mary, upon whom the Angels rejoice and praise the Son of God.\"</p><p>The Queenship of Mary is not an empty title or an honorary distinction showing forth her excellence of virtue, of grandeur, sanctity or glory. Mary is truly a Queen as can be seen in the Gospel of the Mass; the Angel Gabriel greeted Mary with the most startling words ever addressed to a child of Adam: \"Hail thou who art full of grace: the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women.\" Then he continues, \"Do not be afraid; thou hast found favor in the sight of God. And thou shalt bear a son and call Him Jesus. He shall be great and men will know Him for the Son of God, the Most High; the Lord will give Him the throne of his father David, and He shall reign over the house of Jacob eternally; His kingdom shall never end.\" Here is the foundation for our belief in the Queenship of Mary - her Divine Motherhood; she conceived a King.</p><p>Mary is \"Queen by grace\" because she was conceived immaculate, preserved from the slightest taint of sin while her soul was literally inundated with divine grace. \"Hail, thou art full of grace.\"</p><p>She is \"Queen by divine relationship\" for she is related in the first degree of consanguinity in the direct line to Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. A Queen Mother is one whose son later becomes king. Mary's Child, however at the moment of His birth, was already a King, the King of the world. Spiritual writers point out for our consolation that Mary's maternal relationship to Jesus was more exclusive than the other mothers, sine He had no human father.</p><p>Our Lady is Queen also \"by right of conquest;\" Our Lord by His Passion and Death recaptured the human race from the slavery of Satan, conquering all as a King. Calvary was the scene of this conquest. Mary at the foot of the Cross shared intimately with Him in His Sacrifice and the fruits of the Redemption.</p><p>At first it may be somewhat difficult to picture Mary as a Queen, since we think in terms of royalty of the world; yet when we think of the souls who preceded us in the household of the Faith, and glance at Christian art, as it sings of her Queenship, it is not a problem at all.</p><p>Majestically, Christ said to Pilate, \"My Kingdom is not of this world,\" so, too, Our Lady acknowledges herself in humility as a Queen whom all generations call blessed; but she, too, would add, \"my kingdom is not of this world.\" In the Litany of Our Lady, we address her as Queen of Angels, Patriarchs, Prophets, Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins; of Peace, of the Most Holy Rosary; conceived without original sin; and, Queen assumed into Heaven. Christian art represents her crowned with a diadem holding a scepter, seated on a throne.</p><p>The purpose of this feast, Queenship of Mary, is to stir up renewed love and devotion to her; to gather before her throne in heaven, and humbly offer her our homage, unreserved, totally, prayerfully and with the simplicity of abandonment that characterizes a devoted child - \"Reign over hearts and minds of men that they seek what is true; over their wills, to follow solely the good; over their hearts to love nothing but what you love\u2026that man may seek and know the truth and follow what is good, Oh Queen!\"</p>"

As the possessors of the Evangelists's relics, the Venetians honored Saint Mark as the patron of their city, and the churches of the city teem with images depicting scenes from his life. By the time of the Renaissance, the Lion of St. Mark had become the symbol for the city itself.</p><p>The other patron and guardian of Venice was the Blessed Virgin Mary, for according to legend the city had been founded on the feast of the Annunciation. It therefore seemed to the people of Venice that their city had also assumed her attributes of purity, perfection and immortality. Unwalled, their city had remained the refuge of worthy men and singularly unconquered for over a millennium. All of Mary's feast-days were also days celebrated by the secular government throughout the entire Republic.</p><p>There is in Venice a spectacular 18th century reliquary that contains an extremely rare first class relic of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Within this reliquary, which bears the personal seal of Pope Pius VI, is a bundle of the Blessed Virgin's own hair. Since the Blessed Virgin Mary was taken into heaven both body and soul after her death, it is not possible that any other physical relics of her could exist. The sole possible exception would be her hair, and this bundle of her hair had been preserved and venerated since the time of her Assumption in the Holy House of Nazareth. Recent archeological excavations have proven that the Holy House was treated as a Christian sanctuary as early as the 1st century AD. The bundle of the Blessed Virgin's hair is believed to have been brought from the Holy Land by the Crusaders, and is venerated in Venice in the Basilica of Saint Mark.</p>"

    "Saint Bernards Ave": {
        "eng": "<p>Saint Bernard, the first abbot of Clarvaux, was a great ornament and pillar of the Church in the 12th century. Devotion to Mary was his characteristic virtue. Bernard put himself under her protection from childhood, and the Mother of Mercy showed him on many occasions how acceptable to her was his devotion. When young, he had a vision of the Queen of Heaven, by which he learned much on the Incarnation. This vision enkindled in his heart the strongest love for Jesus and Mary. Among other favors he received from Mary was the instantaneous restoration of his health when he lay dangerously ill and physicians had given up all hope of recovery.</p><p>Bernard endeavored to inflame all hearts with devotion to Mary. To excite confidence in her intercession, he would say: \"She does not want power to help us, for she is the Mother of God; nor yet good will, for she is the Mother of Mercy, and our Mother also. She is not a Mother merely of the just but of sinners.\" His writings would alone suffice to proclaim her praise to the end of the world, and to enkindle the love of her in all hearts.</p><p>It was Bernard's custom whenever he passed an image of Mary to bow his head and salute her with the words, \"Ave Maria!\" He did this without fail, and Our Lady to show him how much this pleased her, one day bowed low from her image and smilingly and sweetly answered him with the words, \"Ave Bernard!\"</p><p>\"Mary,\" says Saint Bernard \"is the bright Star of Jacob, whose rays enlighten the whole world, whose splendor shines conspicuous in Heaven, and penetrates hell. It pervades the earth and warms not the body, but the soul, banishing vice, and maturing virtue. For she is that bright and splendid star, elevated above this vast and spacious sea, who glitters by her merits, and enlightens by her example. If you find yourself tossed about by the storms and tempests in the current of this world, turn not your eyes away from the brightness of this star, unless you wish to be overwhelmed by its waves. If the winds of temptation arise - if you strike on the rock of tribulation - look up to this star; call on Mary! If you are tossed about by the swellings of pride or ambition, of envy or detraction - look up to the star, call on Mary! If anger or avarice, or concupiscence, agitate the bark of your mind - turn to Mary! When affrighted at the enormity of your crimes and sins, or affrighted at the defilement of your conscience, or terrified with the dread of the future judgment, you feel yourself about to be involved in the whirlpool of despondency, or engulfed in the abyss of despair - think of Mary! In dangers, in difficulties and doubts; think on Mary and invoke her!</p><p>Let her name never depart from your mouth or heart; and that you may obtain the benefit of her intercession, forget not to imitate the example of her life. In following her, you cannot go astray; in appealing to her, you cannot despair; and in thinking of her, you cannot wander.</p><p>While she supports you, you cannot fall; while she protects you, you cannot fear; while she guides you, you cannot feel fatigue; and if SHE be propitious, you will arrive in safety.\"</p>"

    "Seat of Wisdom": {
        "eng": "<p>\"Seat of Wisdom\" means Temple or Throne of Wisdom. This name is most appropriate to Mary, for Wisdom is a Scriptural name of Our Lord. In the Books of Wisdom of the Old Testament all the beautiful things which are said of Wisdom apply to a Divine Person. Wisdom in these Books is not a mere abstract concept or figurative expression, but the Eternal Word, the Second Person of the Most Holy Trinity. When, therefore, we see an image of Mary with the Infant Jesus in Her arms or seated on Her knee, we have an answer to the question - why is Mary called the Seat of Wisdom? \"Wisdom hath built herself a house,\" says the Holy Ghost in Sacred Scripture. This house, this temple of Wisdom, was, and ever is, Mary.</p><p>When Jesus Christ, Who is the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Wisdom of the Father, took up His dwelling in Mary, He made Her His Temple when He became Man. While He was a little Babe, seated on His Mother's knee, She was in literal truth His throne and temple. We, too, each one of us, are temples of Wisdom, \"temples of the Holy Ghost,\" as St. Paul says. Wisdom is one of the Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost.</p><p>Every time we receive Holy Communion, we become the throne or temple of Our Lord in a most real, physical way; each one of us is then really and truly a \"Seat of Wisdom,\" a throne or temple of Jesus.</p><p>In the liturgical hymn for the Feast of the Dedication of a Church we read how our souls, the living stones for the Temple of the Heavenly Jerusalem, are hewn and polished by the blows of axe and chisel, that is, by the crosses and trials of life, and so fitted to build up the Eternal Temple of God, the Heavenly Jerusalem. But Mary is an exception; She was a perfect, finished temple of holiness even before Her birth.</p><p>\"Wisdom hath built herself a house.\" \"He Who created me rested in my tabernacle.\" She is the \"Wise Virgin.\" But heavenly wisdom is very different from worldly wisdom. Worldly wisdom teaches us to seek after the \"good\" things of this life - money, position, power, pleasure. Heavenly Wisdom, on the contrary, teaches us to hold all these material goods as inferior to the good of the soul, to eternal life. Thus, for instance, if there is a question of marriage, worldly wisdom will ask: \"Is he or she good-looking, wealthy, have a good job?\" and so on; and if these questions are satisfactorily answered, worldly wisdom will tell us that the wisest thing we can possibly do is to take such a chance, for we may never get another.</p><p>But heavenly wisdom will ask: \"What doth it?\" Is there spiritual danger in a marriage with this person? If he or she is not a good Catholic, will not the close and constant companionship of such a one drag me down to worldliness? Will not obstacles be put in the way of my salvation?</p><p>Happy we, if on such an occasion, or others similar, we are always in the habit of having recourse to Mary, the Seat of Wisdom, and thus make it, as it were, as sure as possible for us to act on the principles of heavenly wisdom!</p><p>Oh, what must not Mary have learned from Jesus, the Eternal Wisdom of the Father, during all those years She lived with Him in such close and tender intimacy? The secrets of His Kingdom in Heaven and on earth, His Church, the Mysteries of Faith, the Sacraments, grace, the world of souls, the future of the Church, Her share in His work and Kingdom - all these She learned. He, \"the true Light, which enlighteneth every man who cometh into this world,\" was unveiled to Her as never to a creature before or since. Of Her could be said what God said of His servant Abraham: \"Can I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?\" No wise and learned doctor of the Church ever had such light as Mary, the Seat of Wisdom, on all the wonders of the Kingdom of God.</p><p>And She is ever ready to share Her wisdom with the least of us; we have only to ask Her, and She will give us of the treasures of Her wisdom.</p>"

Imagine the joy in the heart of Mary to learn from the messenger of the Almighty that she, who was willing to be but a handmaid or servant in the household of the Lord, that she was to be really the Mother of God. What joy and happiness at the greeting of the angel. What joy to know that now within her womb she carried the Son of God.</p><p>The second great joy of Mary was the Visitation. \"The Immaculate Virgin Mary joyfully carried Jesus visiting Elizabeth.\" Charity and love inspired this visit. How happily our Blessed Mother must have made her way over the hills to the distant home of her cousin Elizabeth, who also was with child, the future John the Baptist. Womanlike, Mary wanted to tell her cousin and share in the joys of an expectant mother. What an inspiration and joyful example to all the mothers in the world.</p><p>The third of the seven joys of Mary life was the nativity. \"The Immaculate Virgin Mary joyfully brought Jesus into the world.\" Everyone who has ever experienced the bliss of Christmas has had just a faint echo of Mary's joy when she gave birth to Christ. Every mother shares that joy. Mary experienced it in all her innocence and sweetness. She experienced the holy happiness of bringing into the world the Son of God, who was to be the Redeemer and Savior of all men.</p><p>The fourth joy of Mary was that of the Epiphany, which we might express in these words: \"The Immaculate Virgin Mary joyfully exhibited Jesus to the adoration of the Magi.\" Every mother is happy when she can show her child to others. Every mother is joyful when friends or acquaintances or even chance visitors comment about her child, praise it, and even bring it gifts. That was the happy experience of Mary when the three Wise Men came thousands of miles to adore and honor her Child, to bring gifts to her Boy.</p><p>The fifth of the seven joys of Mary, our Blessed Mother, is what she experienced when she finally found Jesus after His three-day loss in the temple. \"The Immaculate Virgin Mary joyfully found Jesus in the temple.\" To have her child with her is a mother's joy. But to find a child that is lost is a greater joy because of the contrast to the sorrow of separation. Mary experienced such a bliss when she found Christ in the temple teaching and listening to the doctors, the learned professors of the law.</p><p>The sixth great joy of the Blessed Mother was the one she experienced upon seeing Jesus after His resurrection. \"The Immaculate Virgin Mary joyfully beheld Jesus after His resurrection.\" Words fail in expressing the happiness of the Mother of God when she saw her Son risen from the grave, saw Him in the full beauty of manhood, saw the Boy whom she had brought into the world, had reared and trained and taken care of for so many years. Her joy, by way of contrast with the grief of the first Good Friday, was supreme.</p><p>The seventh of the seven joys of Mary, and the crowing joy, was that Mary had when she was taken up into heaven and crowned Queen of heaven and earth. \"The Immaculate Virgin Mary was joyfully received by Jesus into heaven and there crowned Queen of heaven and earth.\" No human pen, no human brush can picture or express the joy in Mary's heart when she was finally reunited with her Son in the bliss of the beatific vision. Neither can we express in words the happiness in her heart when she was crowned, rewarded by her Divine Son who made her the Queen of this world and of the heavenly court.</p>"

This dire news was almost impossible to believe in the rest of Christendom, but it was sadly true, and Constantinople was made into the new seat of the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>A few short years later, Pierre D'Aubusson was Grand Master of the Hospitallers, the Knights of Saint John, living on the island of Rhodes. He and his knights were untiring opponents of Islam, sworn to do everything in their power to fight against them. Having made the island of Rhodes their home, the knights harassed Ottoman shipping lanes and assisted with attacks against the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>In the year 1479, D'Aubusson refused to pay tribute to Mehmet in exchange for peace, and furthermore, had the audacity to continue harassing the sultan's shipping lanes. The Grand Master continued to work on the massive fortifications on Rhodes as he awaited the siege of Rhodes that he knew would soon come. His walls were strong, but the Grand Master had only a few hundred knights and about 2,000 natives to defend them.</p><p>Mehmet was not intimidated by the Christian defenses on Rhodes, for he had huge cannons and basilisks which had blasted holes in the stout walls of Constantinople. He also had over 70,000 men in his army, and he was determined to wipe out \"that abode of the sons of Satan,\" as he referred to the Catholic knights of Rhodes.</p><p>The Siege of Rhodes began with a tremendous bombardment on the tower of Saint Nicholas. Grand Master Pierre D'Aubusson was not intimidated as he asked: \"What is more sacred than to defend the Faith? What is happier than to fight for Christ?\"</p><p>Breaches were eventually made in the walls, and the Muslim's unremittingly attempted to rush through the breaches. Many of the Turks had to be forced to attack the defenses, as their commanders lashed them forward with whips and chains. The Janissaries, however, did not have to be urged, for they were the sultan's finest troops. They were warriors to the core, and advanced over the fallen bodies of their comrades, anxious to cross swords with the Catholic knights.</p><p>Finally, the Tower of Italy began to crumble from the terrific assault, and large breaches opened in the wall. The Bashi-Bazouks and Janissaries rushed into the breach, placing the standard of Islam above the tower.</p><p>On witnessing this act, the Grandmaster rushed into the breach together with a few of his excellent knights. Howling and raging like madmen, the Janissaries pressed the assault, for the knights seemed too few to stand against their wave after wave of thousands of elite warriors. Yet the Grandmaster stood, insensible of any wounds he received in return for the carnage he wreaked among the fanatical Muslim warriors.</p><p>Fighting with broken blades and notched axes, the Knights of Saint John continued to hold the breach, cutting down any who approached them, until a huge Janissary rose up and hurled a spear with all his might directly at the Grand Master. Propelled at incredible speed, the sharp steel tip easily pierced D'Aubusson's breastplate, puncturing his lung. The Grand Master went down beneath a torrent of hacking blades as the knights struggled to drag his body from the fray.</p><p>By his courageous stand D'Aubusson had proven he was at least the equal of any Grand Master in history, but now he was wounded unto death and could do no more. The siege of Rhodes appeared to be lost as D'Aubusson's knights struggled to haul him to safety. Thousands of Jannisaries were rushing into the breach with no one to stop them, and at this point the knights knew it would take a miracle to keep Rhodes from being overrun.</p><p>A miracle is exactly what they got. Suddenly there appeared in the sky \"a refulgent cross of gold, by the side of which stood a beautiful woman clothed in garments of dazzling white, a lance in her hand and a shield on her arm, accompanied by a man dressed in goatskins and followed by a band of heavenly warriors armed with flaming swords.\" It was the glorious figures of Saint John the Baptist, the Patron Saint of the Order of Saint John, Saint Michael the Archangel brandishing his unsheathed sword, and the Queen of Heaven, the Blessed Virgin Mary herself, dressed in battle array!</p><p>The Turks turned at the sight and ran in panic-stricken flight. Thousands fell as they fled, cut down and pursued through the breaches by the knights of Rhodes and their heavenly allies. Chased all the way back to their camp, it was now the defeated Muslims who suffered the insult of having their sultan's own standard captured.</p><p>The siege of Rhodes had ended, and Grandmaster D'Aubusson later recovered of his wounds. He had lost 231 of his knights, but that was nothing compared to the thousands upon thousands of Muslim warriors who lay dead upon his shores.</p><p>It was in the year of Our Lord 1480 that the knights of Rhodes had gained this signal victory over the Turks, by the help of the Blessed Virgin, whom the Knights regarded ever after as Our Lady of Victory. They renewed their dedication to her who had appeared on the walls during the siege of Rhodes holding a lance in her hand to defend them, bringing with her Saint Michael the Archangel and a heavenly army. She, the Patroness of the Sovereign and Military Order of Hospitallers, had turned the formerly obstinate enemy, who retired in disorder to lose the greater part of their army. Thanks to Our Lady of Victory, the all-conquering sword of Mehmet II had shattered upon the walls of Rhodes!</p>"

    "Singular Vessel of Devotion": {
        "eng": "<p>What is devotion? Does it mean saying a number of prayers, going frequently to church, having devout and pleasant feelings at our prayers? Some of us may have this idea of devotion, but it is not the real meaning of the word, and above all, it is not the meaning of devotion as signified in this title of Our Lady's Litany.</p><p>Devotion in its true sense means a cheerful promptness and alacrity in all that relates to God's service, in all the duties of religion, in all the duties of life, considered as the expression of God's Will in our regard.</p><p>Devotion is not a matter of the feelings, of sentiment, but of the will. It is not necessary to have delightful and happy feelings at your prayers to be truly devout.</p><p>But if you are always prepared and willing to give God the right place in your life, to put His claims before all else, for instance, to give up living in a place, or a job, you prefer and to choose one less pleasant, if there is a question in the former of a difficulty in getting to Holy Mass - that would be true devotion -  to put God and your duty to Him before everything else, and to do so promptly and cheerfully.</p><p>In Mary we at once see devotion in its true light. God, Her Divine Son, was the one end and aim of Her life. She lived simply and wholly for His service. Her heart was as a burning thurible, from which there ever ascended as an incense of sweetest fragrance, holy desires, acts of love, praise, and thanksgiving. How well we see all this in the only prayer of Hers which is left to us, the Magnificat. It is a perfect picture of true devotion. In the very first verse we find a complete statement of Mary's devotion: \"My soul doth magnify the Lord.\" Here we have summed up all the duties of worship to God. \"And My spirit hath rejoiced in God My Savior.\" Here is the spirit of cheerful promptitude in all that relates to God. The whole of this prayer teaches us what Mary's devotion was - not sentiment, but pure praise, thanksgiving, and petition.</p><p>We can never hope to equal Her in devotion, but we can take Her as our model, picture Her to ourselves, and long to be like Her. We can offer Her Pure Heart to God to supply what is wanting in ours, when we feel cold, dry, and distracted. At such moments let us whisper to Our Blessed Mother: \"Singular Vessel of Devotion, pray for me.\" Never by all the Saints together was God so worthily praised and honored as by Mary's individual love and devotion.</p><p>God's service, His praise and worship, is the greatest, highest, most soul-satisfying act we can perform here on earth. It will be the occupation of our eternity in Heaven, where we shall not want, desire, or be able to do anything else; we shall all then be, perforce, vessels of devotion.</p><p>But if we are faithful in doing day by day as much and as fervently as we can for God, in His service, the day will come when God will make it our greatest joy and happiness to converse with Him, to pray to Him, to be with Him; we shall come to feel by our own experience what the Scripture says of Wisdom: \"Her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but joy and gladness.\" We shall in that day more fully understand the meaning of this sweet invocation, \"Singular Vessel of Devotion, pray for us.\"</p>"

        "eng": "<p>\"All the unmarried men gathered in the temple and prayed to the Lord conjointly with the priests, in order to be governed by the Holy Spirit in what they were about to do. The Most High spoke to the heart of the high priest, inspiring him to place into the hands of each one of the young men a dry stick, with the command that each ask his Majesty with a lively faith, to single out the one whom He had chosen as the spouse of Mary.\"</p><p>\"And as the sweet odor of her virtue and nobility, the fame of her beauty, her possessions and her modesty, and her position as being the firstborn in her family was known to all of them, each one coveted the happiness of meriting her as a spouse. Among them all only the humble and most upright Joseph thought himself unworthy of such a great blessing; and remembering the vow of chastity which he had made and resolving anew its perpetual observance, he resigned himself to God's will, leaving it all to His disposal and being filled at the same time with a veneration and esteem greater than that of any of the others for the most noble maiden Mary.\"</p><p>\"While they were thus engaged in prayer the staff which Joseph held was seen to blossom and at the same time a dove of purest white and resplendent with admirable light, was seen to descend and rest upon the head of the saint, while in the interior of his heart God spoke:</p><p>\"Joseph, my servant, Mary shall be thy Spouse; accept Her with attentive reverence, for She is acceptable in my eyes, just and most pure in soul and body, and thou shalt do all that She shall say to Thee.\"</p><p>\"At this manifestation and token from heaven the priests declared Saint Joseph as the spouse selected by God himself for the maiden Mary. Calling Her forth for her espousal, the Chosen one issued forth like the sun, more resplendent than the moon, and She entered into the presence of all with a countenance more beautiful than that of an angel, incomparable in the charm of her beauty, nobility and grace; and the priests espoused Her to the most chaste and holy of man, Saint Joseph.\"</p>"

    "Spiritual Vessel": {
        "eng": "<p>A vessel is made to contain something.  A \"Spiritual Vessel,\" then, means one made to contain something which does not appear outwardly to the senses, but is of the spirit, of the soul.  \"All the glory and beauty of the King's daughter is within.\"  This title, then, describes the beauty of Mary's soul.</p><p>We should all like to have a detailed description of Our Lady's personal appearance, but this is not given to us.  She is a \"Spiritual Vessel.\"  She hides Her virtues even from Her own eyes, like some lovely flower, folding in upon itself, lest the precious fragrance should escape.  No, every particle of the precious gift is to be kept all alone for Her Beloved.</p><p>It is strange how little mention there is of Our Lady in the Gospels, although before She came, Prophets and the Scriptures had described Her perfections by many wonderful types, such as the great women of the Old Testament - Esther, Judith, and the rest - and by beautiful images, such as the cedar of Lebanon, the cypress tree, the palm tree, the rose of Jericho, the fair olive tree in the plains, and all the others which we read of in the 24th chapter of Ecclesiasticus, and in many other passages from the Books of Wisdom in the Bible.</p><p>This silence of the Gospels about Mary is Her own doing.  She it was who must have instructed St. Luke in the details of the Sacred Infancy and the Hidden Life of Jesus, for no one but Holy Mary and St. Joseph had been eye-witnesses of them.  Yet how little mention there is of Mary; nothing but the barest narration of facts, and then only what is needful for the history of Her Son.   But we have one little phrase which tells us something of what was within that Spiritual Vessel.  \"Mary kept all these words, pondering them in Her Heart.\"  Her thoughts were always full of Jesus, of the words He spoke, of the things which happened to Him.  This was the constant occupation of Her mind, the food of Her thoughts.  Let us consider for a moment what are the ordinary subjects of our thoughts when we are left to ourselves.  If we find we are brooding over slights and injuries, and considering reprisals on the first opportunity, or gloating over some word of praise, some little success which has flattered our vanity, dreaming of future conquests and successes, and perhaps despising others less fortunate, or harboring harsh and uncharitable judgments of others - ah! then our hearts are very far indeed from being spiritual vessels!  Here we may learn a precious lesson from Our Blessed Mother.  We can all ponder, turn over in our minds, the deeds and sayings and events of the life of Jesus, and make them our chosen mental occupation.  Thus our minds will become a little more spiritual, a little more like that of Our Mother, the Spiritual Vessel.  If we persevere in this practice of making Jesus, His Life and His Mysteries, the sovereign preoccupation of our minds and hearts, we shall have found a treasure which will be to us a priceless blessing.  We shall learn gradually to be quiet, contented, and happy within our own minds, and lose that restless craving after outside excitement - which is the source of so much unhappiness - because we have found within an unfailing source of joy and contentment.  The Heart of Mary might well be called \"a vessel of peace,\" for Her mind, as St. Agatha said of Herself, was \"strongly settled and grounded upon Christ.\"  Thus, even with the great tragedy of the Passion so clearly foreseen, and its black shadow ever looming in front, and the deep surges of sorrow welling in undercurrents beneath, Mary could ever say: \"My spirit hath rejoiced in God My Savior.\"  Deep peace, calm, and contentment in God were always Hers.  And they will be ours, too, if we, like Her, ever \"keep all these words\" -  the happenings of the Life of Jesus, pondering them in our hearts.</p><p>Beautiful Spiritual Vessel!  It is the beauty of Mary's soul which it concerns us most to know.  This very hiddenness, silence, secrecy about Herself shows what was Her lowly opinion of Herself.  What does She say?  \"He that is mighty hath done great things to Me.\"  Her whole thought is of Her blessedness in being the Mother of God.  See how many centuries passed before Her own great glory, Her Immaculate Conception, was brought out and proclaimed before men!  It is as though that vase of beautiful and costly fragrance, Her soul and its perfections, were kept sealed up, and only in spite of itself, as it were, let its perfume escape.  She had no desire to attract praise and notice.   Never in Her whole life was there one thought, word or deed aimed at Her own honor, glory or advantage; She was always and only \"all for Jesus.\"</p><p>Are we like Her?  Are we anxious to hide or to publish our own gifts, excellences, and successes?  If ever we are passed over or slighted, and our good points unnoticed, let us think of Our Blessed Mother, the Spiritual Vessel, and how little She cared for praise or notice.  She did not even let Herself think of Her perfections or virtues.  All She did think of was to praise God, and to thank and bless Him for His gifts to Her, and to wish all others to join Her in doing so.</p><p>Our Lord in the Gospel speaks of a wise man who built his house on a rock, and the rains came, and the wind blew upon that house, and it fell not, because it was founded upon a rock.  That is a true image of the soul that lives on Christ, His words and deeds.  That soul is founded on a solid, immovable foundation, which nothing can shake.  The house may indeed tremble amid the violence of the tempest, but the rock cannot be shaken, and the house will not fall, for it has a strong foundation, the soul's faith in Christ.  That is what Mary had.</p><p>Those who are thus founded upon Christ have a something solid within them, upon which they can rest, which completely satisfies all their longings; they are not dependent on pleasures and entertainment, they have something better within their souls.</p><p>Mary was infinitely happier in thus praising and pleasing God only, than any human being has ever been or will ever be in their supremest moment of world-wide fame and success.  For though praise is undoubtedly sweet to all of us, it can never fill or satisfy the soul; it is not what the soul is made for.  Only God can fill and satisfy the soul which was made by Himself for Himself alone.</p>"

    "Spouse of the Holy Spirit": {
        "eng": "<p>Having a child conceived by the Holy Spirit has no direct analogy, because it was a one-time extraordinary event, in order to bring about the incarnation. We should fully expect to have some difficulty understanding it.</p><p>But Christianity is filled with such anomalies, wonders, and paradoxes. How could Jesus be fully God and fully man? Run-of-the-mill logic cannot accept this, anymore than it can grasp the Trinity (hence many heretics deny both). It requires the eyes of faith and a comprehension of the \"both/and\" biblical, Hebraic outlook.</p><p>St. Augustine (354-430) stated that \"Mary was that only one who merited to be called the Mother and Spouse of God.\" (Sermon 208). Scripture speaks in terms of the bride being the Church, and makes analogies between marriage and Christ and His Church. So why should there be controversy about Mary being the spouse of the Holy Spirit?</p><p>By the same general reasoning that applies to Theotokos (arguing solely from the Bible, not Catholic tradition), it seems to me that \"spouse of God\" would also be appropriate and non-objectionable. That Jesus' conception was of the Holy Spirit as a sort of \"Father\" is plain in the Bible:</p><p><em>Matthew 1:18-20 (RSV) Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit; (19) and her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. (20) But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, \"Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit;\" (cf. Lk 1:31, 34-35)</em></p><p>If we ask, then, \"Who is Jesus' father?\" (in terms of the origin of His conception), it's not Joseph, but the Holy Spirit in one sense, and God the Father in another. Multiple senses and meanings and applications are common in Holy Scripture.</p><p>By analogy, then, if Jesus' parents were Mary and the Holy Spirit, then by simple analogy it follows that Mary (in this particular sense, and this alone) is the \"spouse of God\" just as she was the Mother of God.</p><p>Likewise, \"spouse of God\" is thought to imply an equality with God, when in fact it's only a limited analogical description based on Mary's relation to the Holy Spirit in the matter of the conception of Jesus. This description is no more \"unbiblical\" or non-harmonious with scriptural thought than St. Paul saying \"we are God's fellow workers\" (1 Cor 3:9; cf. 2 Cor 6:1), or St. Peter referring to men becoming \"partakers of the divine nature\" (2 Pet 1:4; cf. 1 Jn 3:2). These are similarly understood as not entailing equality with God.</p><p>Along these lines, there are many biblical passages about Israel or the Church being the \"bride\" of God the Father or Jesus Christ, God the Son:</p><p><em>Isaiah 54:5 For your Maker is your husband, the LORD of hosts is his name; . . .</em></p><p><em>Isaiah 62:5 . . . as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.</em></p><p><em>Jeremiah 31:32 . . . my covenant which they broke, though I was their husband, says the LORD. (cf. Jer 3:20)</em></p><p><em>Hosea 2:16, 19-20 \"And in that day, says the LORD, you will call me, `My husband,' and no longer will you call me, `My Ba'al.' . . . (19) And I will betroth you to me for ever; . . . (cf. Hos 4:12; 9:1)</em></p><p><em>Matthew 9:15 And Jesus said to them, \"Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?\" (cf. Mk 2:19-20; Lk 5:34-35; Mt 25:1-10)</em></p><p><em>2 Corinthians 11:2 I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I betrothed you to Christ to present you as a pure bride to her one husband.</em></p><p><em>Ephesians 5:28-29, 32 Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. (29) For no man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, . . . (32) This mystery is a profound one, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church (cf. Rev 19:7; 21:2; 21:9)</em></p><p>Given all of this biblical data, saying that Mary is the \"spouse of God\" should not present any difficulty at all to anyone who accepts the Bible as God's inspired revelation. The only possible objection would come from not understanding what is meant by the phrase in the first place.</p>"

    "Star of the Sea": {
        "eng": "<p>Our Lady, Star of the Sea is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ. The words Star of the Sea are a translation of the Latin title Stella Maris, first reliably used with relation to the Virgin Mary in the ninth century. The title was used to emphasize Mary's role as a sign of hope and as a guiding star for Christians. Under this title, the Virgin Mary is believed to intercede as a guide and protector of those who travel or seek their livelihoods on the sea. This aspect of the Virgin has led to Our Lady, Star of the Sea, being named as patroness of the Catholic missions to seafarers, the Apostleship of the Sea, and to many coastal churches being named Stella Maris or Mary, Star of the Sea. This devotion towards Our Lady with this ancient title is very popular throughout the Catholic world.</p><p>The title most probably has its origin in the Biblical passage 1 Kings 18:41-45, which speaks of a cloud above the sea, no bigger than a man's hand, which is seen from Mount Carmel. The tiny cloud's scriptural significance is as the sign of hope that heralds the end of a long drought.</p><p>A similar message is reflected in another title of Mary, which appears in the official Litany of the Virgin, Morning Star. Both titles refer to Mary as a symbol of hope and as a foreshadowing of the imminent coming of Jesus. A combination of the two themes produces Star of the Sea.</p><p>Around the year 400 Saint Jerome interpreted the Hebrew name of Mary, Miriam, as \"stilla maris,\" or a drop of the sea. It has been suggested as an alternative origin for the term that this may have been miscopied as stella maris. The first reliable use of the term stella maris that is still extant is in the writings of Paschasius Radbertus in the ninth century, who wrote of Mary, Star of the Sea, as a guide to be followed on the way to Christ \"lest we capsize amid the storm-tossed waves of the sea.\" At this time too the plainsong hymn \"Ave Maris Stella\" (\"Hail, Star of the Sea\"), became increasingly popular.</p><p>In the twelfth-century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux wrote: \"If the winds of temptation arise; If you are driven upon the rocks of tribulation look to the star, call on Mary; If you are tossed upon the waves of pride, of ambition, of envy, of rivalry, look to the star, call on Mary. Should anger, or avarice, or fleshly desire violently assail the frail vessel of your soul, look at the star, call upon Mary.\" </p><p>Pope Pius XII in his encyclical, Doctor Mellifluus, also quoted Bernard of Clairvaux in saying; Mary ... is interpreted to mean 'Star of the Sea.' This admirably befits the Virgin Mother.. (for) as the ray does not diminish the brightness of the star, so neither did the Child born of her tarnish the beauty of Mary's virginity.</p>"

    "Tabernacle of the Lord": {
        "eng": "<p><em>The following is a homily given by the legendary Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen during a Mass at the 41st International Eucharistic Congress in Philadelphia in 1976. </em></p><p>Fifty-seven years ago when I was ordained a priest, I took two resolutions: one, that I would say Mass every Saturday in honor of our Blessed Lady, for her protection during my priesthood. The second resolution was that every day of my life I would make a Holy Hour in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament. These two are now conjoined, as I address you on the subject of Mary, the Tabernacle of the Lord. I shall speak of Mary and the Host, Mary and the Sword, Mary and the Holy Hour.</p><p>Not one of us has the power to make our own mother. If we did, we would have made her the most beautiful woman in the world. Our Lord pre-existed His own mother. Therefore He could make her the perfect mother. He thought of her from all eternity. As a matter of fact, the first Immaculate Conception was in the mind of God. When the first Paradise was lost, God said that He would make another Paradise; this Paradise, flesh-girt, to be gardened by a new Adam, would be our Blessed Mother.</p><p>God had told Moses, \"Make a tabernacle that I may dwell with my people.\" Tabernacles were of stone and gold until an angel came to the Blessed Mother and asked her if she would become the mother of our Lord. She said, \"I am a virgin. I do not know man.\"</p><p>And God said: \"In the older tabernacles there was the Shekinah, 'the cloud of my presence,' that overshadowed the temple. Now my Holy Spirit will overshadow you, and he that will be born of you will be called the Son of the Most High God.\"</p><p>Notice Mary did not give birth to a fetus.</p><p>The Word was made flesh and tabernacled within her. In a certain sense, it was Mary's first Holy Communion, for she had within herself the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Christ. Now Communion is not only oneness with Christ, it is oneness with everyone in the Church and oneness with humanity. That is the reason why this Eucharistic Congress spoke of the hunger of the spirit and the hunger of the body.</p><p>So when the Blessed Mother possessed within herself Christ, the first thing she did was to do a social act. She went to visit her old cousin, Elizabeth, who was aleady six months with child. When she came to Elizabeth, Elizabeth said, \"The child leaped with joy in my womb.\" Christ had met John the Baptist in Elizabeth, and John the Baptist adored the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity in Mary. That was the moment when the Blessed Mother became what Pius X called her on the 13th of December, 1905, the \"Mother of the Blessed Sacrament.\" And she radiated the presence of Christ to John. So Elizabeth, now, after adoring the Christ within Mary, venerates her. \"Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\" Elizabeth was here acknowledging that somehow or other Mary is related to the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ Himself.</p><p>Mary was not a priest. If her divine Son wanted women to be priests He would have made His own mother a priest. A woman is the symbol of the Church; and though Mary was not a priest, she was able to say the words of consecration as we priests can never say those words, because her body was giving life to the humanity of Christ. So she could say, as she bore Christ within her, \"This is my Body, this is my Blood.\" Mother of the Blessed Sacrament, pray for us.</p><p>When the divine Child was forty days old, she presented Him to the temple. All gifts come from God, and therefore should be given back again to God. She was doing with our Blessed Lord what will be happening here in this Mass. During the offertory procession, representatives of the Church will bring sacrificial gifts to be offered to the heavenly Father. Mary brought Christ to be offered to the heavenly Father - Simeon, the old man, being a symbol of the heavenly Father. Simeon said to her, as he became prophetic, \"Your Son is going to have a cross, a sign to be contradicted; and you, too, will be pierced by a sword.\"</p><p>Can any of you mothers imagine bringing your child to the baptismal font and having the priest at the font say to you, \"Your son will die on the gallows, and you will have to have your heart broken\"? That is what Simeon told our Blessed Mother.</p><p>Now let us see what this sword meant. \"Your heart, too, will be pierced with a sword.\" When our first parents lost the Garden of Paradise, God stationed an angel with a flaming sword to guard the tree of life. By that God meant Paradise Lost is not Paradise Destroyed; but you'll never get back into this Paradise except by the sword. Sacrifice, shedding of blood, the inspiration of it will be a flame, love itself. So there seemed to be written across the Old Testament - as we read in the epistle to the Hebrews - that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin.</p><p>It is not easy to get back into Paradise. The Jewish priests for centuries, on the Feast of the Atonement, would use this sword to slay a lamb. On the Day of Atonement they would take the blood of the lamb and they would go before the great hyacinth and purple and crimson curtain, the veil, and sprinkle it with blood. That gave them the right to enter the Holy of Holies, the symbol of Paradise. But on Good Friday, when that priest took the blood of a lamb and began to sprinkle that veil, it was rent from top to bottom. Man could rend it from bottom to top. And amid the shrieks and cries of the people, the Holy of Holies, which had never been seen, was now open. But that was nothing compared to what was happening on Calvary. A soldier took a sword and ran it into the heart of Christ. Blood and water came forth; blood, the symbol of our redemption; and water, the symbol of our regeneration. And the heart - or the veil of His flesh, as the epistle to the Hebrews puts it - the new Holy of Holies, was revealed; Paradise was opened; Eden's gates were now thrown wide. Cherubim, sheathe your swords; the Sacred Heart has revealed heaven.</p><p>But when that sword pierced the heart of Christ physically, it pierced the heart of the Mother mystically.</p><p>I remember once being in a clinic and seeing a doctor touch an infant that was held by the mother. And the infant would cry with pain. And every time the infant cried, the mother shook with pain, out of sympathy.</p><p>Here were two hearts impaled on a single sword, the heart of Christ and the heart of Mary, these two hearts, which were then united in sorrow. And I believe that this is the basis for the Assumption. Christ's passion as the Son of God merited redemption; Mary as a creature shared that passion as much as she could, and therefore as a creature she should be assumed into heaven.</p><p>But these pierced hearts in our times have become related to the Eucharist. One of the last things we give to anyone is a heart. We give them our time, we give them our talents, we give them gifts, but the last thing is the heart. And as the world grows old, we have had a revelation of the heart of Christ and the heart of Mary; and both of them were related to the Eucharist. On the 10th of June, 1675, our Blessed Lord, holding his heart with a cross on top of it, said to St. Margaret Mary, \"Behold this heart, which has loved men so much; and all that I have received is blasphemy, ingratitude, coldness and contempt in the Sacrament of my love.\"</p><p>In the revelation of Fatima, the Immaculate Heart revealed to the children a chalice and a host; and the Immaculate Heart, pierced with a sword, said to the children: \"Pray to the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity in the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist to make up for all the outrages and sins that are committed by man in the world.\" Joining in love and sympathy with those two hearts, one of the great beauties of this Eucharistic Congress will be, I hope, to stop the de-Eucharistization that is going on in the world today.</p><p>How often, for example, I have gone into small churches and I have had to look around to find the good Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. He has been shoved off in a corner, and some priest stands there like a tin god. One almost feels like Mary Magdalene, going into many churches today. \"They have taken my Lord and I know not where they have laid him.\"</p><p>Then, too, the number of our people that will go to Communion in the state of mortal sin, in the language of St. Paul, \"eating, drinking judgment unto themselves.\" They would not go to a dress ball the way they go to Mass. What has happened to courtesy, respect, when they go before the Infant Savior as if they were going to a beach? And then immediately after receiving Holy Communion, leaving the Lord without appropriate thanksgiving - something they would not do if they had even had dessert in a neighbor's house, leave immediately after they had eaten.</p><p>You know, I believe that we are living in a world of broken hearts. Our heart is broken; the Heart of Christ is broken; the Immaculate Heart of Mary is pierced. A small piece is missing out of the side of every human heart. God kept that in heaven, so that we can never love anyone in this world with a whole heart. The Sacred Heart is broken, because it has been pierced by our sins; the Immaculate Heart, because of her love for her divine Son.</p><p>How are we going to heal these broken hearts? I think what we have to do is to bring our broken hearts to the Blessed Mother and ask her to take them into her own and into the heart of Christ; because St. Paul says that we are working toward a day when Christ will be complete, when He will be the Totus Christus. Then let Mary deliver over our hearts to Christ, and we will have the Totus Christus, the Whole Christ, the only Love in the world.</p><p>And, finally, the Holy Hour. In the Sacred Scripture God has His day, the devil has his hour. In the Gospel of St. John, the word \"hour\" is used seven times, and in every single instance it refers to evil, the sinfulness of men, the deceit of the devil; so that at the end of the tragic hour of our Blessed Lord, He can say to Judas, \"This is your hour. All you can do is just turn out the Light of the world.\" So the word \"hour\" refers always to evil.</p><p>The first time our Lord used the word \"hour\" was at the marriage feast of Cana, when the Blessed Mother asked Him to work a miracle.</p><p>Now the reason the wine gave out is because our Lord brought all of His disciples also. It was the first case of gate-crashing in the history of Christianity.</p><p>And our Blessed Lord said to His Mother, \"My hour has not yet come.\" \"My hour.\" What He is saying to her is, \"My dear Mother, are you asking me to proclaim my divinity, to go before men as the Messiah and the Son of God? Do you realize that the moment I do that your relationship with me changes? You will then no longer be my Mother, you will be the Mother of everyone that I will redeem; so I call you the beautiful name of 'Woman,' the universal Mother of the world.\"</p><p>Another time when our Lord used the word \"hour\" was at the Last Supper, and here He refers to His Mother. He had already said \"my hour.\" Now He says, \"When the woman\" - in our English translation it is \"a woman.\" In the original Greek it is \"the woman.\" \"When the woman is in childbirth she suffers, because her hour has come; but she rejoices when a child is born into the world.\" In other words - and this is something I had never thought about until I began preparing this meditation - she has a Holy Hour, and our Lord was then speaking about it. Our Lord spoke about that hour on the cross. \"When the woman brings forth a child\u2026.\" Our Blessed Lord looks down from the cross to His Mother, and He says, \"Woman, there is your son\" - John. And to John, \"There is your mother.\" Mary at the foot of the cross was the symbol of the Church. Our Lord on the cross was the new Adam. She was the new Eve.</p><p>The night of the Last Supper, our Blessed Lord spoke about the woman bringing forth children when her hour comes. Now the hour had come. And John stood for all of us that were ever born into the Church.</p><p>So the Holy Hour, inasmuch as it is related to our Lord, refers to reconciliation, redemption, forgiveness. The Hour in relationship to the Blessed Mother refers to the Church. Accouchement - birth. Labor - a child. Pain - joy. In other words, evangelization, conversion, the growth of the Church.</p><p>Because we live in a demonic age, the time has come to take seriously this Holy Hour. It is the only thing our Blessed Lord ever asked us to do, ever asked directly of His disciples: \"Can you not stay awake one hour with me?\"</p><p>Who should make it? Bishops, for an apathetic world, so that during that Holy Hour the Blessed Lord will speak to them, as He spoke to Paul at Corinth. \"Be courageous, be not silent, speak out, I am with you.\"</p><p>I have many in this city who are my friends, priests. Make the Holy Hour. It may be a sacramental sign of our victimhood. Would you have power in the pulpit? Would you be able to console the sick? Would you be able to make converts? Then spend the Hour with our Lord. When you mount the pulpit you will shoot forth sparks, and the people will love you.</p><p>Sisters, you wonderful women, who bear a visible sign of your union with Christ, make the Holy Hour - and understand how much the children in schools are yearning for you to come back.</p><p>Married couples, make the Holy Hour, to make up for an abortion every thirty seconds. Prove that the Lord is the Lord of life and not of death.</p><p>All you who are engaged in social work, treating humanity in any form, make the Holy Hour. Believe me, when you begin to see the invisible Christ behind that visible sign of Bread, you will soon begin to see in the poor and the naked the invisible Christ whom they represent. That is the vision that makes Mother Teresa one of the leaders of the world in the love of the poor.</p><p>And you young people, young men and young women, do not believe that the joy of life consists in a titillation of the flesh, but see that love is sacrificial; and when you make a Holy Hour, then you will begin to understand that the real rock is Peter, and the gates of hell shall not prevail.</p><p>Everyone, make the Holy Hour, and you will discover as you leave the divine Presence that if you move among people in the world, they will say of you as the maid said of Peter, \"You have been with Christ.\" And then at the end of a lifetime spent in adoration of the Lord, and in love of the Blessed Mother, of the Blessed Sacrament, when you come before the Lord do you know what He will say to you? He will say, \"I heard my Mother speak of you.\"</p>"

    "The Annunciation": {
        "eng": "<p>This feast was instituted by the apostles, and is the most ancient of all.</p><p>Absorbed in profound contemplation, the humble Virgin of Nazareth, Spouse of Joseph, the Carpenter, was pondering the ills which afflict humanity, at the same time fostering in her heart the most ardent longing for the advent of the Messias promised by the prophets. Suddenly a heavenly messenger presented himself to her. It was the Archangel Gabriel who, bowing with reverence before her, said, \"Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\" And the Virgin thought within herself what manner of salutation this might be. Then the Angel went on to explain to her: \"Thou hast found grace with God.\" \"Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a Son; and the Lord will give Him the throne of David His Father\u2026and He shall reign over the house of David forever and His Kingdom shall have no end.\"</p><p>But Mary said to the Angel: \"How shall this be done, since I know not man?\"</p><p>And the angel answering, said to her:</p><p>\"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy One which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God\u2026\"</p><p>The Angel awaited her reply. Then Mary said:</p><p>\"Behold the Hand-maid of the Lord, be it done unto me according to thy word.\"</p><p>Fiat  -  \"Be it done\" is a mark of desire, not of doubt. Fiat may also be understood as a word of petition, for no one prays unless he believes and hopes to obtain. God wished to be asked. This Mary understood, when she said, \"Be it done.\"</p><p>The human mind will never understand perfectly how much the Incarnation accomplished in Mary at that moment. When she was raised high above all angels and men, she abased herself as much as is possible to a creature. Her greatness was equaled only by her humility. Her blind obedience was the crowning act of her devotedness to God's will all the years before the Annunciation. It was the manifestation of her interior sanctity and beauty of soul which, as one of the Fathers has said, \"ravished the heart of the Son of God and drew Him down to her bosom.\" This spiritual conception through faith and obedience was a far greater thing to Mary, we are told, than her conception of Him in the flesh. Mary's consent to be the Mother of God was given on our behalf, too. This incarnation was a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and our humanity.</p><p>The mystery of the Annunciation reminds us of our indebtedness to Mary, as well as of her glories.</p><p>This feast of the Annunciation has left its impress on all the arts. Religious and military orders have perpetuated this feast in many ways; the Angelus daily reminds us thrice of it.</p><p>We ought to revive interest in a feast as great as this; it is one of the greatest feasts of the year to a world which so badly needs Good News; the Irish call it \"Lady Day,\" and we simply call it the feast of the Annunciation.</p>"

    "The Coronation": {
        "eng": "<p>The idea of the coronation of Mary in Heaven after her Assumption took its rise in an accommodation of the words in the Song of Songs (4:8),</p><p>\"Come, my bride, from Lebanon..thou shalt be crowned..,\" and was chiefly developed and popularized by iconography.</p><p>The earliest existing example is probably the mosaic in Santa Maria in Trastevere at Rome, where Our Lady is depicted already crowned, sitting at the right hand of her Son; this dates from about 1140. A century later there appeared what became the usual design, Christ putting a crown upon His Mother's head.</p><p>The theme of the coronation of Mary was popular in English medieval carving, and it was everywhere highly embroidered and developed at the Renaissance. Among more recent artists the subject has aroused little interest, and Catholics today are familiar with it chiefly from the last glorious mystery of the rosary.</p><p>Its meaning suggests the final \"moment\" of the Assumption and the reference in the Apocalypse to \"a crown of twelve stars.\" It seems to be a second feast of the Assumption, emphasizing the bodily aspect of the mystery.</p><p>\"After placing the most blessed Mary on this exalted and super-eminent throne, the Lord declared to the courtiers of heaven all the privileges She should enjoy in virtue of this participation in his majesty. The Person of the eternal Father, as the first principle of all things, speaking to the angels and saints, said to them:</p><p>\"Our Daughter Mary was chosen according to our pleasure from amongst all creatures, the first one to delight Us, and who never fell from the title and position of a true Daughter, such as We had given Her in our divine mind; She has a claim on our dominion, which We shall recognize by crowning Her as the legitimate and peerless Lady and Sovereign.\"</p><p>The Incarnate Word said:</p><p>\"To my true and natural Mother belong all the creatures which were created and redeemed by Me; and of all things over which I am King, She too shall be the legitimate and supreme Queen.\"</p><p>The Holy Ghost then said:</p><p>\"Since She is called my beloved and chosen Spouse, She deserves to be crowned as Queen for all eternity.\"</p><p>\"Having thus spoken the three divine Persons placed upon the head of the most blessed Mary a crown of such splendor and value, that the like has been seen neither before nor after by any mere creature. At one and the same time a voice sounded from the throne saying:</p><p>\"My Beloved, chosen among the creatures, our kingdom is Thine; Thou shalt be the Lady and the Sovereign of the seraphim, of all the ministering spirits, the angels and of the entire universe of creatures. Attend, proceed and govern prosperously over them, for in our supreme consistory We give Thee power, majesty and sovereignty. Being filled with grace beyond all the rest, Thou hast humiliated Thyself in thy own estimation to the lowest place; receive now the supreme dignity deserved by Thee and, as a participation in our Divinity, the dominion over all the creatures of our Omnipotence.</p><p>\"From thy royal throne to the center of the earth Thou shalt reign; and by the power We now give Thee Thou shalt subject hell with all its demons and inhabitants. Let all of them fear Thee as the supreme Empress and Mistress of those caverns and dwelling-places of our enemies. In thy hands and at thy pleasure We place the influences and forces of the heavens, the moisture of the clouds, the growths of the earth; and of all of them do Thou distribute according to thy will, and our own will shall be at thy disposal for the execution of thy wishes.</p><p>\"Thou shalt be the Empress and Mistress of the militant Church, its Protectress, its Advocate, its Mother and Teacher. Thou shalt be the special Patroness of the Catholic countries; and whenever they, or the faithful, or any of the children of Adam call upon Thee from their heart, serve or oblige Thee, Thou shalt relieve and help them in their labors and necessities. Thous shalt be the Friend, the Defender and the Chieftainess of all the just and of our friends; all of them Thou shalt comfort, console and fill with blessings according to their devotion to Thee. In view of all this We make Thee the Depositary of our riches, the Treasurer of our goods; we place into thy hands the helps and blessings of our grace for distribution; nothing do We wish to be given to the world, which does not pass through thy hands; and nothing do We deny, which Thou wishest to concede to men. Grace shall be diffused in thy lips for obtaining all that Thou wishest and ordainest in heaven and on earth, and everywhere shall angels and men obey Thee; because whatever is ours shall be thine, just as Thou hast always been ours; and Thou shalt reign with Us forever.\"</p>"

    "The Immaculate Conception": {
        "eng": "<p>This festival began in the East, more than nine hundred years ago, since mention is made of it by Saint John Damascen, who lived n 721. It was instituted in England in the year 1100 by Saint Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury; afterwards in the diocese of Lyons in the year 1145; and final, Pope SixtusIV commanded, in the year 1576, the celebration of it throughout Christendom.</p><p>At the very first moment of conception in the womb of Saint Ann, Mary's soul was flooded with the fullness of grace: \"all fair, all beautiful.\" The laws of man and of nature did not apply to Mary. Her soul was flooded with light so that she could make her acceptance of the Mystical Marriage with her God.</p><p>\"You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse, you have wounded my heart...My sister, my Birde is a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up...Thou art beautiful, O my Love, sweet and comely; terrible as an army set in array...One is my Dove; My perfect one is but one; she is the holy one of her mother, the chosen of her that bore her. How beautiful art thou, by dearest delights!...Put me as a seal upon they heart, as a seal upon thy arm, for love is strong as death...\" - thus God speaks to her in the \"Canticle of Canticles,\" and Mary replies:</p><p>\"I found Him Whom my soul loved...\"</p><p>Mary's Suscipe - the most perfect act of surrender a creature ever made, an oblation which would have a permanent re-echo every moment of her life, her bridal consecration, her mystical union with God was spoken at the very first moment of her being. Fiat - Be is done to me...</p><p>There was never a questioning of God's will in the life of Mary; but it was always perfect acceptance of whatever He planned and wanted of her. Therein lies Sanctity - doing God's will, not ours, regardless. Yes, even the Motherhood of Mary as the \"Mater Dei\" depended on this, for Christ in the Gospels says:</p><p>\"Who are My Mother and My Brethren? If anyone does the will of My Father, he is My Mother and My Brethren.\"</p><p>You, who love the Blessed Mother so intimately should certainly desire with all your heart to imitate Mary's fiat in every instance of life. Strive for this initial complete consecration to the Will of God in everything, regardless. At the root, foundation of every life lived for God, there must be a \"Suscipe\" \"Take O Lord, and receive all my liberty, my will...\" and a Fiat in deepest love and conformity to God's Holy Will. In return God will favor you with peace, joy of service, but, also, as He did His own dear Mother, with Suffering; but, always, He will give you the grace to say with Mary, \"Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it done unto me according to Thy Will.\"</p><p>Mary is \"our tainted nature's solitary boast, and we are her children. Should not a daughter try to resemble her Mother in everything? Mary is the Treasure-house of God's graces; she will give whatever we ask of her.</p>"

One of the teachers at the college gave them a lithograph copy of a painting by the Italian painter, Luigi Crosio. In the beginning, the boys did not really like the picture and some said that it would need several changes from an aesthetic point of view. Since they did not have money to buy another picture, they placed this picture in the Shrine over Easter 1915. This picture has always remained in the Shrine since then.</p><p>The picture originally had the name, 'Refugium peccatorum'  -  Refuge of Sinners. The young Schoenstatt group soon found a title that held greater meaning for them because of their own history: Mater Ter Admirabilis  -  Mother Thrice Admirable. Midway through 1916, this title was used to honour the picture of the Blessed Mother in the Schoenstatt Shrine. 'MTA' (as she is often called in Schoenstatt) is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase 'Mater Ter Admirabilis.' Its literal meaning is 'greatly admirable mother.' More recently, however, this title for Our Lady has taken on more symbolic meanings. For example, she is called Thrice Admirable because she is the Mother of God, the Mother of the Saviour and Mother of the redeemed. She can also be described as Thrice Admirable because her faith, her love and her hope.</p>"

    "Apparition to Saint Catherine": {
        "eng": "<p>Saint Catherine of Alexandria, also known as Saint Catherine of the Wheel, is a Catholic saint, virgin, and martyr. She was the beautiful daughter of King Costus and Queen Sabinella of Alexandria, who at a young age decided to remain a virgin until and unless she should meet someone who exceeded her in status and political position, as well as beauty, intelligence, and wealth. She decided upon Christ, who reigns over us all, for \"His beauty is more radiant than the shining of the sun, His wisdom governs all creation, and His riches are spread throughout all the world.\"</p><p>While yet a teenager, Saint Catherine received a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Her Divine Son Jesus Christ. In this vision, the Mother of God gave Catherine to her Son in a mystical marriage. Mystical marriage is in some senses very similar to a marriage ceremony, as Christ presents the chosen soul with a ring that is often visible to others, and often there are saint and angels present. There have been well over 70 documented mystical marriages with saints, and although the action is mysterious and not well understood, it appears that Christ gives special attention to these saints. Saint Teresa explained that it was the highest state a soul could achieve in this life, and represents a transforming and constant union with the Blessed Trinity.</p><p>Saint Catherine was martyred by the Roman Emperor Maxentius when she refused his proposal of marriage. Again, according to tradition, her body was taken by angels to Mount Sinai where a church and monastery were built in her honor. Saint Catherine's relics were rediscovered about the year 800, and it was said that her hair was still growing and that there was a continuous stream of oil coming from her body that was found to have miraculous healing properties. King Saint Edward was said to have collected some of that oil and taken it back to his kingdom with him.</p><p>Saint Catherine, along with Saint Margaret, were the two saints who spoke to encourage Saint Joan of Arc in her mission.</p>"

    "Tower of David": {
        "eng": "<p>Towers are for two purposes, either strength and defense, or for beauty and ornament. In the next two titles of Our Lady's Litany, towers are considered under these two aspects - and first in the primitive sense of the word, as a stronghold of defense and security in war. To address Our Lady as \"Tower of David\" really means, \"Our Lady of Soldiers\" or \"Our Lady of Victories.\" This title is no doubt inspired by that text of the Canticle of Canticles: \"Thy neck is as the tower of David; a thousand bucklers (small round shields) hang upon it, all the armor of valiant men. We do not need to be told what a great war it is, in which we need the defense of this strong tower, the Mother of God. It is the great battle between God and the Devil, between good and evil. This war concerns every one of us; whether we like it or not, we have all got to take part in it, to take sides, to fight, one way or the other. There is no such thing as remaining passive and neutral. Our Lord has said: \"He that is not with Me, is against Me.\" What a terrible thing! To be against God! And this we shall be if we are indifferent in this great war.</p><p>Which side are you on? You may smile at the question, and reply that, of course, you are on the side of God. But are you a true and valiant soldier? Have you fought this day, are you fighting this hour, this minute? You know the three enemies that we Christians have to fight against all the days of our life - the Devil, the world, and the flesh. Are you really, consciously, actively struggling against these three enemies? Sometimes it seems a weary, hopeless, endless business. Do you not occasionally feel like throwing down your weapons and saying: \"Oh, I can't be good; it's no use trying! I will give up!\" It seems so dull, so boring to be good. You want to have \"a good time,\" you say, like others do - to live, to get some enjoyment out of life. Well, you are not shut out from joy by being good - far from it. But no doubt one sometimes has to sacrifice pleasure and fun to duty, play to work.</p><p>Where are you going to get allies to join you in your fight against these rebellious feelings? We have the answer in this title, \"Tower of David.\" In the Office of the Feast of the Most Holy Rosary there is the antiphon, Virgo potens, sicut Turris David, mille clypei pendent ex ea, omnis armatura fortium. It is the mighty Virgin, like the Tower of David; a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armor of valiant men. Here Mary is compared to a strong fortress, full of weapons, to which you can always fly for refuge in the fray, and where you will find fresh armor and strong weapons for the fight. This was what the Tower of David was - a fortress where weapons were kept. Our Lady likes us to fight bravely; She looks on approvingly and says: \"Well done, good and faithful soldier.\" She is Our Lady of Victories, and without a fight there is no victory. Let us be brave in heart, and when beginning to get the worst of it, let us call upon Mary, the Tower of David. Oh, how willing we shall find Her to help us! Let us then remember, when life is hard, when things go wrong, when we have to bear failure and disappointment, and are cross and depressed, weary and hopeless, or inclined to let things slide and yield to our own selfish inclinations, when we have unpleasant work to do, or hard duties to perform, to overcome our temper, or sloth, or selfishness, or feelings of rebellion, let us call upon Mary, the Tower of David, and remember that in Her we shall ever find \"all the armor of valiant men.\" Tower of David, pray for us. She is an ally who can never fail us. She will never desert us, or turn a deaf ear to our call for help. St. Paul said: \"I can do all things in Him who strengtheneth me;\" so may we, children of Mary, say of our Mother, the Tower of David, \"In Mary I can do all things.\"</p>"

    "Tower of Ivory": {

So that some rich person of those lands might, if he pleased, have a tower overlaid with plates of ivory.</p><p>When we say \"Tower of Ivory,\" the very words call up in our minds a glowing image of delicate beauty, a celestial structure with pinnacles and spires of dazzling whiteness, resplendent in the sunlight, lovely in shape as well as in substance, a very picture of elegance and stainlessness, a truly appropriate image of the Most Pure Virgin Mary. Its dazzling whiteness suggests to us the spotlessness of Her soul. As the ivory tower was for the king or owner of the vineyard in which it was built - a place of pleasure and delight, so was Mary's soul to Jesus.</p><p>We too must strive to make our souls such that Jesus will find in them a place of pleasure and repose. There, by the purity of our souls, may His eyes be soothed and refreshed in His disappointments. To a Saint Our Lord once said: \"My child, I am weary and sorrowful with the sins and ingratitude of men; open to Me the dwelling of thy heart, that I may find a little rest with thee.\" The soul of that Saint must in some way have resembled Mary's, the Tower of Ivory; it must have been pure, calm, peaceful, and lovely. In the same way, if we strive to keep our souls calm, free from restless desires and turbulent passions, Our Lord will be able to come and take His pleasure in us, as the king of olden times did in his ivory tower. \"His place is in peace.\"</p><p>And we, too, need a tower of refuge in our troubles and difficulties, a place where we can hide from the attacks of our passions. At those times we may think of Mary as the beautiful, graceful, pure, peaceful Tower of Ivory, opening to us its gates, ever ready to receive us and soothe us back to peace and calm of soul. Fly to Her, ask Her to shield you from the hot blasts of passion, to restore the calm, the peace, the serenity of your soul that you, too, may grow into a lovely tower of ivory for Our King and Lord.</p><p>The whiteness of ivory is, of course, the emblem of purity, and reminds us by contrast, how shameful and degrading is the opposite vice. Let us pray to Mary, the Tower of Ivory, that we may ever prize the purity and spotlessness of our souls above all things, and that She may preserve us from all sin, especially grievous sin, so that Our Lord may always find in us a choice dwelling-place.</p><p>We are told that Our Lord said of St. Gertrude: \"You shall find Me in the heart of Gertrude.\" And every year in the Office of her feast, these words are chanted: \"In the heart of Gertrude you shall find Me, My soul hath delighted in her.\" She was a true copy of Mary, the Tower of Ivory. But Jesus will not find in us a peaceful dwelling, if our souls are full of passionate desires, troubled, turbulent, and like a lake in a storm  -  for \"His place is in peace.\" \"The Lord is not in the whirlwind,\" that is, \"non in commotione Dominus\"  -  not in anything that is in agitation</p>"

When the Seldjoucid Turks had subjected their old masters, the pilgrims of Europe, who ventured into Syria to visit Jerusalem and Nazareth, suffered barbarous treatment, the recital of which, inflamed the whole of the West, causing an eruption into Asia.</p><p>When Godfrey of Bouillon had been proclaimed King of Jerusalem, Tancred, whose lofty deeds have been sung by Tasso, was named governor of Galilee; this prince, who was very devout to Mary, proved his devotion by the sumptuous offerings with which he enriched the church of Nazareth.</p><p>After the disastrous expedition of King Saint Louis, that corner of the earth, which was regarded as the cradle of Christianity, was defended foot by foot by the brave Knights Templars, who shed tears of rage and blood at the sight of the holy places profaned by the Saracens.</p><p>The last Christian stronghold was at Acre.

In Sacred Scripture, in the Church, throughout all ages, Our Lady has been honored as no creature has ever been.</p><p>The Apostles looked upon Her as their Queen, and held Her in the highest veneration. The most learned of the great Doctors of the Church consecrated volumes to Her praise and to the explanation of Her dignity, excellence, graces, and virtues.</p><p>The Church has in every age kept up this tradition. Benediction was frequently accompanied by Her Litany, or some other chant in Her honor, the Ave Maria, the Salve Regina, and countless others. The most beautiful music of the Church's liturgy has been reserved for Her hymns and antiphons. The Divine Office ends every day with an antiphon to Her. Her feasts run through every month of the year, and the whole of the month of May is Hers. The month of August is dedicated to Her Immaculate Heart and Her Assumption; the month of September to Her Nativity and Her life-long Sorrows; and the month of October to Her Holy Rosary. Her shrines are to be found all over the world, where in every age She has shown Herself to men. Processions, hymns and devotions honor Her all the year round. What a distinguished place She holds even in the great Feasts of Her Son! They are nearly as much Hers as His, especially the Offices of Advent and Christmas. A statue of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary is one of the distinguishing marks of a truly Catholic church. Countless books have been written about Her and many new Feasts in Her honor have been added to the liturgical cycle throughout the ages. Every true Pope has tried to do something special for Her. Her holy Name is invoked by every true Catholic, morning and evening; the Angelus three times a day keeps Her ever in our minds; Her medals, pictures and statues form part of every Catholic's life. Nothing is done in the Church without Her. Our Lord's promise is daily fulfilled. And in Heaven, He still shows Her the honor due to a mother, as the writings and revelations of the Saints testify.</p><p>\"He that honoreth his mother, heapeth up a treasure.\" Let us, too, take our part in this universal homage paid to the Mother of God. Every sigh, every look to Her, every act in Her honor, is treasured up by Jesus and by Her, and will have its reward. If there is one truth more universally witnessed to than another, it is that no act of devotion to Mary goes unrewarded. A holy writer says: \"All who honor Mary in this world, will be honored by Her in the next.\"</p><p>We may consider this title under another aspect. The value of a gem is argued from the costliness of the setting that encases it, how carefully it is treated, and with what care it is handled, because of what it contains. But Mary was the shrine which contained the great God, the Creator of the world. What honor, what reverence, then, is due to Her! How strict was the watch She kept over every act and thought, so that nothing unworthy of Her high estate might be found in Her. How high-principled, how honorable in all Her dealings must She have been. Like Her, each one of us should also be a vessel of honor, for we so often receive Our Lord in Holy Communion. She was seen in vision as \"the Woman clothed with the sun.\" After Holy Communion we are all \"clothed with the Sun,\" the Sun of Justice; we are all penetrated and saturated with Jesus. Let us then do nothing to lower or degrade ourselves either in body or soul; let us be honorable in all our dealings, true and straight and just, that we also may deserve to be called, each in his own degree, \"vessels of honor.\"</p>"

He became king of France at only 17 years of age, and married Joan of Navarre in 1284, which enlarged his kingdom.</p><p>In the year 1302, Philip sent an inadequate army into Flanders to suppress the Flemish, who were making incursions into his realm at will. His army was soundly defeated at the Battle of the Golden Spurs.

It is recorded that on this day angels were heard, near the city of Soissons, singing this anthem:</p><p>\"Felix namque es, sacra Virgo Maria, et omni laude dignissima, quia ex te ortus est Sol justitiae, Christus Deus noster.\"</p><p>Vigils were kept on the evening before each feast day from the earliest days of the Church. On that evening all of the faithful would gather together to prepare themselves and their dispositions for the feast they were about to celebrate. This might also include listening to readings from the Bible, or a sermon on the topic by a priest. Mass would then be celebrated on the feast day, and the fast would be broken. It is said that both Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome practiced and fully supported the idea of the vigil. The Vigil of the Assumption would have been one of the Church's most important vigils.</p><p>\"Of the glory and felicity of the saints in the beatific vision saint Paul says with Isaias (I Cor. 2,9; Is. 64, 4), that neither have mortal eyes seen, nor ears heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man what God has prepared for those who love Him and who hope in Him. In accordance with this Catholic truth, we should not wonder at what is related of saint Auguestine, the great light of the Church, that, in setting out to write a book on the glory of the blessed, he was visited by his frined, saint Jerome, who had just died and entered into the glory of the Lord, and was admonished by his visitor, that he would not be able to compass his design; since no tongue or pen of man could describe the least part of the blessings enjoyed by the saints in the beatific vision. Such is the testimony of saint Jerome; and if through holy Scriptures we had no other information than that this glory is eternal, it would be beyond all our comprehension. For, however much of our intellect may expand, it will never comprehend eternity; and as this is infinite and boundless, it is inexhaustible and incomprehensible, how much soever it may be known and loved. Just as God, the Infinite and the Almighty, created all things, without being thereby exhausted, and even if He had created endless worlds ever anew, would remain still infinite and immutable; so also, although seen and enjoyed by countless saints, He will remain an infinite source of new knowledge and love; for in creation and in glory all creatures participate in Him only to a limited extent, each according to its condition, while He in Himself is without limitation or end.</p><p>\"If on this account the glory even of the least of the saints is eneffable, what shall we say of the glory of the most blessed Mary, since among the saints She is the most holy and She by Herself is more like to her Son than all the saints together, and since her grace and glory exceed those of all the rest, as those of an empress or sovereign over her vassals?\"</p>"

This birth happened on the eighth day of September, fully nine months having elapsed since the Conception of the soul of our most holy Queen and Lady.</p><p>Saint Anne was prepared by an interior voice of the Lord, informing Her, that the hour of her parturition had come. Full of the joy of the Holy Spirit at this information, she prostrated herself before the Lord and besought the assistance of his grace and his protection for a happy deliverance.</p><p>Presently she felt a movement in her womb similar to that which is proper to creatures being born to the light. The most blessed child Mary was at the same time by divine providence and power ravished into a most high ecstasy. Hence Mary was born into the world without perceiving it by her senses, for their operations and faculties were held in suspense. As She had the use of her reason, She would have perceived it by her senses, if they would have been left to operate in their natural manner at that time. However, the Almighty disposed otherwise, in order that the Princess of heaven might be spared the sensible experience otherwise connected with birth.</p><p>She was born pure and stainless, beautiful and full of grace, thereby demonstrating, that She was free from the law and the tribute of sin. Although She was born substantially like other daughters of Adam, yet her birth was accompanied by such circumstances and conditions of grace, that it was the most wonderful and miraculous birth in all creation and will eternally redound to the praise of her Maker.</p><p>At twelve o-clock in the night this divine Luminary issued forth, dividing the night of the ancient Law and its pristine darknesses from the new day of grace, which now was about to break into dawn. She was clothed, handled and dressed like other infants, through She excelled all mortals and even all the angels in wisdom. Her mother did not allow Her to be touched by other hands than her own, but she herself wrapped Her in swaddling clothes: and in this Saint Anne was not hindered by her present state of childbirth; for she was free from the toils and labors, which other mothers usually endure in such circumstances.</p><p>So then Saint Anne received in her arms Her, who was her Daughter, but at the same time the most exquisite Treasure of all the universe, inferior only to God and superior to all other creatures.</p>"

The Virgin's face has a kind expression, and is inclined toward the child Jesus, who is holding a goldfinch. Above her head, two angels are poised to arrange a crown. Above them is a third angel with a banner that reads: \"Ecce Maria venit ad Templum,\" referring to the festivity of the Purification. At the feet of the Virgin is a woman found on her knees. The background of the image is golden, adorned with the finest geometric patterns. While the exact age of the image is unknown, experts have traced its origin to approximately the third century, and it is a work done in the Byzantine style.</p><p>When the Muslim's invaded the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century, the Christians of Seville built a fa\u00e7ade before the image to keep the Moors from defacing it. The church was profaned and turned into a Muslim place of worship, and so after a period of centuries the knowledge of the existence and location of the image was lost.</p><p>In the year 1248, when St. Fernando III was besieging Seville, when the Saint was kneeling in prayer before the Virgin of the Kings, Our Lady spoke to him through the statue and said: \"You have a constant in my image of the Antigua that you love so much and which is in Seville.\" Then, Our Lady encouraged him to continue the siege, promising him the victory.</p><p>St. Fernando was instantly overwhelmed with a holy desire to venerate the image of the Virgin de la Antigua, and was miraculously guided through the city and into the mosque where the image lay hidden behind a wall. Upon his arrival, the blank wall faded from sight, becoming as transparent as the finest pane of glass, allowing Fernando to gaze upon what no man had beheld for many centuries. There, untouched, its secret hidden by the solid wall, was the painted image of the Queen of Heaven holding her Infant Son in her arms.</p><p>Fernando was completely unaware of the passage of time as he prayed before the heavenly portrait. It had always been his intention to make Mary the Mistress and Queen of Seville, and when he conquered the city he shattered the obstructing wall and brought this glorious masterpiece to light for all of Christendom.</p><p>When the Spanish knights crossed the ocean and came to the New World, they also brought their devotion to Our Lady under the image of the Virgen de la Antiqua. One of these images has been displayed at the Cathedral of Mexico since the year 1652.</p>"

    "Virgin Most Faithful": {
        "eng": "<p>What is it to be faithful?  When we say a person is faithful, we generally mean that he or she is true, loyal to a superior, to a friend, to a cause, or truthful and exact in fulfilling obligations.  A faithful friend is one you can depend upon to be true to you in misfortune and failure.  A faithful servant adheres to his master, no matter what danger or difficulty comes in the way.  A faithful person is \"full of faith\" in the sense that you can fully trust in him or her.</p><p>Never was there a heart so faithful as Mary's.   First of all, in Her own life on earth, how true She always was to Our Lord in every need or sorrow or trial of His Life, from the sufferings and privations of his Infancy, the terrors of the Flight into Egypt, all through His Passion and Death on the Cross, She was always with Him, always ministering to Him, and even at the last, when She could do nothing more for Him, She stood by the Cross to the very end, fearing no danger to Herself, all Her thoughts fixed on Him.  \"There stood by the Cross of Jesus Mary, His Mother.\"  These words are a history, a picture, of Mary's fidelity, its crown and consummation.</p><p>But there remained what was perhaps a still more searching test of Her fidelity to Jesus.  He left Her bereft of His visible presence.   He left to Her the care of His Church, His Mystical Body, then in its infancy as it were, just born, and needing a mother's care.  Her whole Heart was with Jesus; earth was to Her without Jesus nothing but a blank wilderness, and yet She did this last hard task for Her Son's sake, just as She had done so many others.  For fifteen long, weary years She lived patiently on without Him, fulfilling the charge He had left to Her, ministering to His Church, as She had done to Himself in His Infancy, watching over His Apostles and disciples, sympathizing with them in their difficulties, advising them in their doubts, encouraging them in their trials, assisting by every way in Her power, saving souls by Her example and Her mighty intercession.</p><p>St. John Berchmans Now in Heaven, to this very day, She is the same steadfast, loyal, faithful Virgin, so true to Her servants and Her children, that no one has ever served Her in the very least thing that has not been repaid a hundredfold.  Who could count the souls of sinners saved by Her just because they had showed Her small honor or done Her some little service?  She has been faithful to them; She will be faithful to us. Let us, in turn, be faithful to Her.  St. John Berchmans, when asked what was the best devotion to Mary, answered: \"Quidquid minimum, dummodo constans.\"   (\"Anything, no matter how small, provided one is faithful to it.\")</p><p>We need never fear to be forsaken by Mary, the Virgin Most Faithful.  In the Apocalyptic Vision the Son of Man is styled \"faithful and true,\" and Mary, who so closely resembles Jesus, may also be described by these two words, \"faithful and true.\"  What a consolation for us to reflect on this truth!</p><p>We may, again, interpret \"faithful\" as \"full of faith.\"  How true of Mary is this aspect of faithfulness also!   \"Blessed art Thou that hast believed,\" said St. Elisabeth to Mary.</p><p>She was ever most faithful to Jesus, She was all for Him, all His; Jesus filled in Her the place that self holds in us.  When we say with St. Gabriel, \"the Lord is with Thee,\" one meaning of the prayer is that Our Lord is with Her inseparably and sovereignly, even as self is dominant in us.  She is ever holding Him up to us, even in Her very statues and pictures, saying: \"Whatsoever He shall say to you, do ye.\"</p>"

She is \"rich unto all that call upon Her.\" \"Until the world to come,\" She once told a Saint, \"I shall not cease to be the Mother of Mercy.\"</p><p>In the Hail Holy Queen, we salute Our Lady as Mother of Mercy. Mercy is Her most distinctive virtue and characteristic. No one else bears this title.</p><p>What does Mercy mean? The Latin word misericordia expresses more than our \"mercy;\" it means, literally, \"a heart for the miserable,\" that is, a heart full of compassion for those who are suffering, a heart ready to pardon and forgive. Clemency, as in the title Virgo Clemens, means showing mercy to the guilty who have deserved punishment.</p><p>Now if there is one thing we all need, it is mercy, clemency. We are all sinners, we all need forgiveness. \"Forgive us our trespasses,\" Our Lord instructs us all to say in His Prayer.</p><p>Our Blessed Lady realizes far more than we can ever do, how great is our wretchedness when we have sinned, and so She longs with an earnestness we cannot picture to obtain for us pardon and mercy. This is Her own special office - to show mercy, clemency, forgiveness. Whenever we say these words, \"Virgin Most Merciful,\" we should call to mind that we are sinners, in need of mercy, of Mary's powerful help, and beg Her to obtain for us the great grace of an abiding sorrow for our sins. Go to Her in all your trials, for no friend or dear one on earth has more than a fraction of the sympathy and compassion that She feels for you.</p><p>We must also try, in honor of the clemency of Our Mother, the Virgin Most Merciful, to show mercy and compassion in our turn to all who suffer. \"As you do to others, so also will My Heavenly Father do to you.\" We must be merciful in thought, word, and deed. \"Judge not, and you shall not be judged.\"</p><p>Of the \"valiant woman,\" who is a type of Mary, we read that \"the law of clemency is on her tongue,\" that is, all she says is inspired by tenderness and mercy. Note that the word used is clemency, indicating that there may be something to be pardoned, to be forgiven; even when dealing with undeniable faults, \"the law of clemency\" is observed by this Valiant Woman.</p><p>There is one act of mercy and compassion which it is in the power of every one of us to practice, and which gives very special joy to Our Most Merciful Mother, and that is, to help the poor suffering souls in Purgatory. Our Lady once said to St. Bridget: \"I am the Mother of all the souls in Purgatory, for all the pains that they have deserved for their sins are every hour in some way mitigated by my prayers.\" There is perhaps no offering we can make which will be more pleasing to Her than prayers and acts of self-denial for the relief of the souls She most specially desires to help. There is nothing She desires so much as to bring these poor souls out of their prison of suffering, and present them to Our Lord, and by our prayers and sufferings we can help Her to do this.</p><p>By sympathy, by feeling for the sorrows of others, by pity for all poor and suffering people, by kindness to the poor, and above all, by readiness to forgive and excuse those who have injured or hurt us, we shall most especially honor Our Mother, the Virgin Most Merciful.</p>"

    "Virgin Most Powerful": {
        "eng": "<p>This is a title which should fill our hearts with confidence.  We know Mary is stainless, lovely, all-fair, all-loving, but if She were not as powerful as She is lovely and lovable, we could not repose full confidence in Her.   And thus this glorious title comes to remind us of the power of our Queen.</p><p>What is power?  It is ability to do great things, to overcome enemies, to come off triumphant in spite of all obstacles, to carry through our wishes to a successful issue.</p><p>How does Mary exercise this wonderful power of Hers?   Mary, above all others, most perfectly fulfilled all the precepts of Her Divine Son.  Now, one day, we find that He gave a little discourse on the very subject that is now occupying us - the use of power.  He said: \"You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that are greater, exercise power upon them. It shall not be so among you; but whosever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister: and he that will be first among you, shall be your servant.\"</p><p>No one ever fulfilled this precept so perfectly as Mary.  That is how She shows Her power, by helping everyone, by being everyone's helpmate and servant as well as Queen.</p><p>Mary's power to help us lies above all in Her intercession.  Her prayers are not the supplications of a servant, but the commands of a Queen.  Jesus chose to be subject to His Mother as Her Son, on Earth, and even now, in Heaven, He has not laid aside His filial reverence for Her.  She is for all eternity God's Mother.  But besides this, She has been crowned by Him as Queen of Heaven and Earth, a dignity far above that of any other creature.  All are Her subjects in Heaven and on Earth.  What then can we fear, what can we not do and obtain, what can cast us down, when we have on our side an advocate so powerful as Mary, our tender Mother?</p><p>We have a striking instance of Her power over Her Son's Heart, when She was still on Earth, in the miracle of the marriage feast of Cana.  Christ, on that occasion, said that His hour for working miracles had not yet come; and yet at her mere suggestion (\"they have no wine\") He set aside His own plan and changed the water into wine.  The whole incident is Our Lady's doing; it is She who instructs the waiters to do whatever Our Lord would tell them.  Is not this why this miracle is recorded - to show us what Mary's power was, even while She was here on Earth?</p><p>Let us always call upon Mary for help with entire trust.  We have seen how She longs to be asked for help.  We may learn, too, how needful is prayer - for all Mary's power is in Her prayer.  It is by prayer to Her Son that She does all that She does, and it is His Will, as we have already said, that all graces should come to us through Her intercession.</p><p>We read that St. Benedict once appeared to St. Frances of Rome and promised to be her advocate with the Mother of God; for whatever he, or any Saint, wishes to obtain for his clients, has to be first asked for by Mary.   Thus is explained that word of Psalm 44: \"All the rich among the people shall entreat Thy countenance.\"  The Saints are the rich of that great people of God, who, when they wish to obtain a favor from Him for their clients, recommend themselves to Mary, and She immediately obtains it.</p><p>This same power of prayer, though in a lesser degree, is in the hands of all of us, even of the weakest, poorest, most ignorant.   We can all pray, and more than this, we must all pray, if we would be saved.   God has decreed that, as a rule, He will grant His graces only through prayer.   Let us, then, all make use of this great power of intercession for ourselves and for others. Our Lord says: \"You ought always to pray, and not to faint,\" that is, never to grow tired of praying.  \"Whatsoever you shall ask, believing, you shall obtain.\"  Trust, confidence that we shall get what we ask, is the disposition God requires of us, and how can we fail in this needful confidence when we reflect that even in our smallest prayer we can have on our side the Virgin Most Powerful?   Even the Saints in Heaven, as we have said, have to go to Her to get their prayers answered.  Let us call upon Her first of all, and we shall most surely obtain answers to all our petitions.</p>"

Her pupils heard her say some sharp things about those \"indiscreet\" people, and the occurrence made a certain impression upon them.  When later on they made their first confession, each, unknown to the other, added to the list of their sins the item, \"I have been indiscreet.\"  When this had gone on for two or three confessions, the priest asked what they meant by this, and when they replied that they did not know, he told them not to say it again.</p><p>We may be too wise to make such a mistake, but it is well, nevertheless, to beware of indiscretion, for it is a fault against prudence  -  a virtue which, as a rule, may be said to be hardly thought of, unless from a worldly point of view; for there is a worldly, selfish prudence, which directs all our efforts to looking after our own rights.</p><p>Prudence is one of the four cardinal virtues, and it was one in which Our Blessed Mother Mary excelled, for She is called in the Litany, \"Virgo Prudentissima,\" \"Virgin Most Prudent.\"  Prudence is the virtue which is opposed to rashness, heedlessness, inconsiderateness.  \"Evil is wrought by want of thought as well as want of heart.\"  Perhaps we never have reflected that rashness is an occasion of sin, and that if we are heedless and imprudent, it is not part of God's plan to preserve us from the consequences of our own imprudence.</p><p>We may all, on looking back on our past lives, see that many of our falls were due to rashness.  Some companion, perhaps, had proposed a plan which promised pleasure or gain.  On the spur of the moment, we followed our rash guide, and had reason afterwards to repent of our folly.  We may have done something that we were afterwards ashamed of, and tried to conceal it; and so one fault led on to another, and it all began by want of reflection and by heedlessly following an impulse.</p><p>How much harm can be done by a person who never thinks before he or she speaks!  Such a one hurts people's feelings and makes mischief.  People distrust him or her, for they never can be sure what he or she will say or do, whose words and acts are not guided by reason.</p><p>Our Lady was most perfect in prudence; She was careful, guarded, circumspect in all She said or did.  She reflected, and was silent and asked God's help before She spoke or acted.  When the Angel announced to Her that She was to become the Mother of God, She thought over his words and asked, \"How shall this be done?\" remembering that She had consecrated Herself to God, and could agree to nothing that might interfere with Her vow.  There are on record only seven occasions on which She spoke at all, and how wise, how guarded, how prudent, were Her words on all those occasions!</p><p>It is a very good occupation when we are making meditations to take the Gospel and study these words of Our Blessed Lady.  Notice to whom She speaks, what She says, what is Her motive for speaking, as, for instance, Her kindness and charity at the marriage feast of Cana.  It may be that when we are among strangers, we are less careful than we would be among friends.  We are carried away by the novelty and excitement of our surroundings and experiences, and perhaps say things that we afterwards find to have been very foolish, nay, even wrong.  We may be amongst worldly people, who gossip uncharitably, and we join in and add to the mischief by our unconsidered words.  All this comes from want of prudence.  We are, again, not careful to keep things secret that were told us in confidence.  Love of excitement is likely to lead us into much imprudence.  We will join in anything that promises amusement, regardless of consequences.  If this is our disposition, we should watch over ourselves very carefully, that we may not be led astray.</p><p>We may, for instance, be led into extravagance and debt, if we are with people who gamble for high stakes, and we join in without reflection.   We may, in the same way, be led into temptation by rashly reading some book or magazine which is dangerous or unsuitable for us, or by watching some film which is harmful.  We should ask advice about these things, and heed the warnings of the wise.</p><p>It is a positive duty to be thoughtful, foreseeing, circumspect in all our doings.  If it is our habit to act on the spur of the moment, to give way to every passing impulse, we shall certainly sin against prudence before long, and against every other virtue when the occasion presents itself.</p><p>Let us fix our eyes on Mary, the Most Prudent Virgin, and ask Her help and guidance in everyday matters.  Act, like Her, always on principle, that is, according to rule and law, in all the small things of life, and you will gain a habit of carefulness and prudence which will guide you if you are unwittingly exposed to the society of people who might otherwise be an occasion of sin to you.  Be wise in time.  Do not wait to be taught, by bitter experience, the evil results of rashness, inconsiderateness and want of prudence.</p>"

How Mary treasures all such words about Her, and how faithfully She will reward and bless them! Ask Her to give you the occasion and the grace to frequently explain, honor and praise Her in a worthy manner.</p><p>\"Glorious things are said of Thee, O City of God!\" These words may well be applied to Mary.

Each one of us can help to preach Our Blessed Mother by distributing books, medals and pictures of Her. All this preaches Her, makes Her known. Even if people only take them with some vague notion of honoring Her, Our Lady will reward our faith and zeal by giving them graces. Many are the conversions recorded which began in this way.</p><p>We should also love to read good books about Mary, so as to increase and deepen our knowledge of the greatness, the dignity, the privileges of Our Mother, and so be able to speak of Her, when occasion offers, more worthily. When we read the beautiful and profound things said about her by the great Saints, even if we do not fully enter into their meaning, our notion of Her greatness and dignity is insensibly exalted, and we gradually grow in the true knowledge of Her.

We must understand and give to Mary in our own minds, Her rightful place in the Kingdom of God.  What is that?  She is the Queen of Creation, the Queen of the Universe, holding a position which is Hers alone, unique in creation. She is high above all the creatures of God, excepting only the Sacred Humanity of Her Divine Son, Jesus Christ.  She is the Queen of Angels, the Queen of the Saints, the Queen of the Church Militant, Triumphant, and Suffering, the Queen of Heaven, of Earth, and of Purgatory.  All, all are Her subjects. She is beneath absolutely no one, but God.</p><p>Now if this is Her position, what reverence must be due to Her!  How careful should we be that our love for Her should ever keep this element of profound veneration!  We should be penetrated with the deepest reverence for Her and for everything consecrated to Her.</p><p>How people are despised if they transgress the rules of good breeding even in ordinary society!  How much more intolerable must unworthy behavior appear in the presence of royalty!</p><p>And all this is but a mere outward shadow of the reverence we owe to Mary.  This veneration may seem to us to have in it an element of fear.  But it is not a base or servile fear; it is the filial fear of offending one whom we deeply love and respect, not for a dread of any consequence to ourselves; it is simply a restraining influence which keeps us from any unbecoming act, posture, or word in Her presence, and above all, towards Her.</p><p>For instance, if, in reciting your Rosary, either in public or private, you feel tired or bored, veneration for our Blessed Mother will keep you from unrestrained yawning, looking around, or rattling off the Hail Marys, and still more from being a distraction to others.</p><p>Can you imagine anyone behaving heedlessly in the presence of a Pope, King, or President, here on earth?  No, every act, word or attitude has to be carefully regulated; nothing unseemly would be dreamt of or tolerated.</p><p>Yes, our actions, words and prayers should be respectful and worthy of our Mother and Queen.  But Our Lady is far more concerned that our hearts be right  -  that we take Her for our own beloved Mother, like St. John did when Jesus gave him to Her as Her son.  She is indispensable to each one of us in our spiritual life, which is the life of Jesus within us.  Each of us has to become another Christ. Mary is as necessary to this supernatural life of ours as She was to Jesus in His Childhood, as our own mother is to us in our natural life.</p><p>Fix these two ideas  -  the greatness of Mary in Herself (Her place in creation) and Her necessity to us (Her place in our spiritual life)  -  firmly in your mind, and you will begin to have a true devotion to Mary.</p><p>Great Queen though She is, Mary is the most tender of mothers.  She is the easiest to imitate of all the Saints.  She was always humble, was always modest, lowly, hidden.  She did not affect showy, spectacular virtues or ecstasies and visions, but the little lowly virtues of everyday life, charity, patience, forbearance, etc., were her practice.  She never put Herself forward, never showed off, never appeared to outshine others.  When it was necessary in giving a history of what happened in the Gospel, to mention Her name, it is put last, after all the Apostles, \"they were persevering in prayer in one mind, with Mary, the Mother of Jesus.\"  She loved and served Jesus with Her whole being, She helped everyone She could, She remained with Our Lord in His sufferings.  She kept His words and deeds in Her Heart, meditating on them. We can all do these things.  We need never be afraid to come to Mary after a fall, for She is the Refuge of Sinners.  She is our Queen as well as our Mother.  How wonderful that She, Who is the greatest of all creatures, should be so loving, so tender, so affable, so entirely at the service of every one of us! Is not this the one impression which every story or account of Her gives?   What a profound lesson in humility for us!</p>"

The cloth had room for two other images at the side, and it was decided to put Saint Anthony of Padua at the right and Saint Andrew the Apostle at the left. The painting was done in tempora, but since the chapel was of straw, the paint faded under the action of the sun, the air and the rain.</p><p>The damage was such that the town priest had it removed from the altar as unworthy for the celebration of Holy Mass. The canvas was taken to Chiquinquira and was used for a rag to dry the wheat under the sun. Seven years later Dona Maria Ramos arrived from Spain and grieved to find the chapel used for animals. Day after day she prayed there that Mary comfort her soul, hopeful that her prayers would be heard. On Friday, December 26, 1586, at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, the canvas was suddenly brightened by the Holy Virgin. Maria was in pious astonishment, almost in a trance, and soon the miracle drew crowds of people.</p><p>This wonderful happening was followed by miraculous cures. The Church authorities ordered an investigation to be made of the Virgin of Chiquinquira to verify the truth of the miracle and in the year 1630, the Dominican Brotherhood authorized by the archbishop of Bogata, took charge of the sanctuary, and built a church which was replaced by the present Basilica in 1801. The Holy See, after discussion of the wonderful miracle, granted a liturgical feast day that is celebrated with special services also in some sections of Venezuela and Ecuador as well.</p><p>In 1919, by order of the Holy See, the Holy Image was crowned with splendor in Bogata, and in 1944 it was granted the gold scepter and precious jewels as the mother queen of Colombia. The Virgin of Chiquinquira is the comforting heart of Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador; prelates, magistrates, and other leaders of the nation have knelt down at Mary's feet and throngs of people, rich and poor, continuously flow to this place to pray for consolation and guidance through this earthly life.</p>"

    "Virgin of the Battles": {
        "eng": "<p>In the year of Our Lord 1224, in Castile, King St. Fernando III was making preparations for the resumption of the centuries old battle of the Reconquest.</p><p>While he was busy about this work, his beautiful young wife, Beatrice, was resigning herself to the sacrifices that would be necessary to support her husband in this endeavor. Knowing of his great devotion to Our Lady, she resolved to give him the greatest gift possible while at the same time entrusting his safety in a special manner to the Mother of God.</p><p>Beatrice commissioned a small ivory statue of Our Lady holding her Infant Son upon her lap that Fernando would be able to keep near him while on campaign. St. Fernando so loved this image of his heavenly Mother that he had his saddlebow specially modified so that the statue would be able to ride before him and be his constant companion.</p><p>This statue of Our Lady came to be known as the Virgin of the Battles since she rode before him into every battle that he was to fight during the next 38 years.</p><p>St. Fernando was the King of Castile and Leon, but he primarily considered himself to be a soldier for Christ. He sought only the glory of God, and fought for the coming of the reign of Jesus Christ in the greatest number of hearts. Fernando truly desired to conquer Spain so that he could give it to his Lord, and none of his plans of conquest were engaged in with any thought of increasing his own glory. The Reconquest was the worthy cause for which he had vowed to devote his life, and Fernando desired nothing more than to deliver Spain from Muslim domination for the sake of souls. Our Lady was to reward her servant with the grace of never suffering any injury in battle and never losing a battle.</p><p>Members of the Catholic clergy also went with the soldiers, including bishops and archbishops. Their purpose was to celebrate the divine office, preach the word of God to the soldiers, and exhort them to frequent the sacraments, and, according to the formal instruction of the king, impress upon them the need to confess and receive communion before each battle.</p><p>St. Fernando, for his part, did not omit any of his religious practices during his many campaigns, and usually spent the entire night in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament and this image of Our Lady preceding any taking up of arms.</p><p>At the end of each battle Fernando would remove the Virgin of the Battles from his saddlebow for a ceremony intended to give glory to God and His Holy Mother. He would place her on an elevated surface and adorn the area with fresh ivy or flowers. One of the clergy that traveled with them would intone the Te Deum in thanksgiving, as the King and the whole army would answer in full choir. After that they would bandage the wounds of those who needed it and dig graves to bury the dead piously.</p><p>Our Lady of the Battles can still be seen today. She resides in the Cathedral of Seville in Spain near the incorrupt body of her servant, King St. Fernando III.</p>"

    "Virgin of the Kings": {
        "eng": "<p>In the year 1248, King Saint Fernando III of Leon and Castile was laying siege to the city of Seville. The long months of sacrifice and constant labor dragged on one after another, a continuous ordeal that seemed never ending. With the coming of summer, the trial passed almost beyond human endurance. Men literally died from the stifling heat, and the \"severe conditions gave the impression that boiling air had been sent up from the pits of hell.\"</p><p>As if this new affliction were not enough, at the same time a deadly sickness struck Fernando's camp that also began to take the lives of many of his men. One of those who died was Don Gonzalo Ruiz Giron, the king's chamberlain, personal advisor, and more than anything else, his close friend. To lose such a friend, for King Fernando, \"was like watching the last line of land disappear on the horizon, and finding himself suddenly alone between the sky and the open sea.\" These severe trials \"...had a demoralizing effect on Fernando's spirit, submerging him in a deep anguish that he had never before experienced.\"</p><p>This was the beginning of Fernando's dark night of the soul, as for the first time in his life he was experiencing grave personal doubts, and a severe spiritual conflict that included feelings of utter despair and complete isolation. King Fernando had only to look around himself to see how his knights were fighting for their lives in daily combats, suffering from incredible heat and privation, sickened and dying from the malady that had struck his camp. \"He, who had always been energetic and optimistic in human affairs, and full of faith and hope spiritually, had always been able to face situations that others would have considered desperate, without the slightest mistrust in God's help ever entering his mind.\" Now it was different.</p><p>Fernando's second wife, Queen Joan, knew her husband well. Although Fernando tried to hide his sufferings behind a confident smile, she felt certain he was enduring a great trial, perhaps the greatest of his life. She made it her duty to help him through this crisis, and to see him at peace once again.</p><p>Dona Joan had always known of her husband's special devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. She sent a message requesting that the finest artist in the entire kingdom be sent to her to create an image of Our Lady more beautiful than any he had ever seen.</p><p>After a while, two young artists arrived, stating that they had responded to the summons. Dona Joan found a private room in an old tower for them to work. A guard was set to keep the artists safe from Muslim attacks, and the pair kept their door locked from the inside as they went about their work.</p><p>The day finally came when the artists sent a message for the Queen to come and view their work. Responding at once to the work room, Queen Joan was dismayed to find that there was no response to her knocking, and that the door remained locked from the inside.</p><p>When the door was finally forced, no sign of the artists remained. There was only the completed statue, a statue of regal beauty that surpassed all other known images of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Dona Joan knew at once that the statue had not been made by human hands, for only angels could have vanished from that locked work room, and only angels possessed the wisdom and skill necessary to have produced such a wondrous work of art.</p><p>In a state of astonishment and awe, Dona Joan knelt before the image of the Queen of Heaven, an image that would soon become known as the Virgin of the Kings.</p><p>The statue needed only a gown. Queen Joan desired to use a costly, rare and beautiful silk. Dona Joan and her maids sewed the garments while goldsmiths in Toledo prepared exquisite golden crowns for the Blessed Mother and her Child. The statue was then secretly taken during the night to the chapel while King Fernando completed his turn at the night watch.</p><p>The following morning King Fernando went to Mass and observed the statue at the altar. Fernando \"was enraptured by the appearance of the Lady he was allowed to contemplate,\" andQueen Joan was delighted with the joy the image gave to the king.</p><p>However, the difficulties the army faced continued without respite, and so did Fernando's dark night of the soul. Finally one evening when King Fernando went to the chapel to pray, he lay prostrate on the floor before the statue of the Virgin.</p><p>\"Help me and defend me! Thou art the Mother of Mercy. So, dost thou not see, my Lady, how these thy sons are in very great toils and combat and sufferings of hunger, illnesses and deaths, so many and such that they can endure it no longer? Dost thou not see, Lady, how the devil attempts to sow doubts in me that I will not make thee Queen of this city of Seville, where so many of thy sons and servants loved thee so much? Was it, then, only a figment of my imagination when I saw Saint Isidore and from his mouth heard that it was the will of Christ thy Son that I should conquer Seville? I beg of thee as intently as I can, as I do not seek or want anything but His glory and service, that thou wouldst give me a sign by which I might know for certain that He receives pleasure in this enterprise in which we are, and with this certainty, thou well knowest my Mother and sweetest Lady, that I will never tire of it, nor could anything stop me  -  neither death nor riches, nor even the forces of hell because grace would not be lacking.\"</p><p>Desiring to look upon the sweet face of his heavenly Mother, Fernando got up to kneel as he continued to plead for relief.</p><p>\"Thou wert always, Lady, my help, and thou tookest me out of all of my troubles...Why dost thou now let me suffer like this? Remember, Lady, Cordoba and Jaen and of all my conquests that were made with thy grace...It is true that I have committed many sins and well deserve these sufferings; but they are suffered not only by me, but by my vassals, and watching them causes my grief to become immense. Queen and Mother of Mercy, help me!\"</p><p>Fernando beheld the image of his Mother through tear filled eyes, and it seemed the Virgin's head inclined slightly toward him. Shadows and darkness can at times make an image look distant and somehow sinister, yet the features of the Holy Virgin appeared even more endearing and motherly than usual in the flickering candlelight. Then, Fernando discerned another subtle change as the lips of the statue moved and a delicate smile graced the beautiful face of Our Lady. Fernando gazed in ecstasy as he saw the lips form the syllables of his name as she softly called:</p><p>\"Fernando!\"</p><p>\"What dost thou want of me, Lady?\" Fernando answered without hesitation.</p><p>\"You have a constant helper in my image of the Virgen de la Antigua that you love so much and which is in Seville.\"</p><p>Then there was a brief silence as Fernando continued to behold the breathtaking beauty of his heavenly Mother. Finally, she gave her devoted son the answer and consolation for which he had been waiting:</p><p>\"Continue, because you shall win.\"</p><p>Encouraged by the Mother of God, Fernando did carry on with the siege of Seville, and in November of 1248 the city was finally conquered. The Virgin of the Kings was solemnly enthroned in the Cathedral of Seville and there she remains to this day. She is reposed above the incorrupt relics of her devoted servant, St. Fernando III, King of Castile and Leon.</p>"

    "Holy Virgin of Virgins": {
        "eng": "<p>Foretold in the scriptures and attested to by the Apostles, Fathers, and subsequent Council's of the Church, the Catholic tradition always witnesses to an indissoluble link between Mary's Virginity and the Incarnation of the Word. It is perhaps one of the most wondrous mysteries of our faith that Our Lady was a virgin ante partum, in partu, and post partum (before, during, and after) the birth of Our Lord. In that familiar passage from Isaiah 7:14 we read, \"Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel.\" In the Gospel of St. Luke (1:34-35) we see how this momentous occurrence came to pass when we read of Mary's encounter with the Angel Gabriel; \"Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man? And the angel answering, said to her: the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\" But what of this link, why is it important and what can we take from this?</p><p>There are a number of approaches to this question. Not least is the fact that the birth of Our Saviour should come from one who, immaculately conceived, was guided from birth by the Holy Spirit to remain as a 'pure and spotless vessel' for the birth of Our Lord. For Mary, as the Mother of God, this relationship was truly unique and the depths of this mystery are quite profound to dwell on. But aside from the importance of our venerating Mary for her role, can the example of her virginity really help us today; all of us that is, no matter what our situation as married, single, celibate, widowed, and so forth? I think, without question that it can, because Our Lady's virginity was not simply a physical matter but a matter of the heart which disposed her most suitably for her role in God's plan. Mary's physical virginity (virginitas carnis) is a symbol of her virginity of heart (virginitas cordis); she is the true exemplar of our faith. Our Lady is the faithful disciple, who without any defilement, falsehood, or pride submitted gladly to God's will and fulfilled her role with steadfastness, humility and compassion. What better example could we have of faithfulness of heart, of true and thankful submission to God's will, than her? Likewise, we all have our unique part to play in God's plan and our disposition to be open, faithful, and pure of heart, is essential if we are to flourish as God's children. If we nurse pride and allow vice to take its hold upon us then we lose our virginitas cordis, so let us instead take our example from her and thus be led to Christ.</p>"
