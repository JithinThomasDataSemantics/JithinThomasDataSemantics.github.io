As a reward for her great humility, God gave her the power and mission of assigning to saints the thrones made vacant by the apostate angels who fell away through pride. Such is the will of the almighty God who exalts the humble, that the powers of heaven, earth and hell, willingly or unwillingly, must obey the commands of the humble Virgin Mary. For God has made her queen of heaven and earth, leader of his armies, keeper of his treasure, dispenser of his graces,mediatrix on behalf of men, destroyer of his enemies, and faithful associate in his great works and triumphs.\"",

Others may do as they please since they are [...] reckless of the future life, which is to be obtained only by sufferings.
