							God will make a way<br/>
							Where there seems to be no way<br/>
							He works in ways we cannot see<br/>
							He will make a way for me<br/>
							<br/>
							He will be my guide<br/>
							Hold me closely to His side<br/>
							With love and strength for each new day<br/>
							He will make a way, He will make a way<br/>
							<br/>
							Oh, God will make a way<br/>
							Where there seems to be no way<br/>
							He works in ways we cannot see<br/>
							He will make a way for me<br/>
							<br/>
							He will be my guide<br/>
							Hold me closely to His side<br/>
							With love and strength for each new day<br/>
							He will make a way, He will make a way<br/>
							<br/>
							By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me<br/>
							And rivers in the desert will I see<br/>
							Heaven and Earth will fade but His Word will still remain<br/>
							And He will do something new today<br/>
							<br/>
							Oh, God will make a way<br/>
							Where there seems to be no way<br/>
							He works in ways we cannot see<br/>
							He will make a way for me<br/>
							<br/>
							He will be my guide<br/>
							Hold me closely to His side<br/>
							With love and strength for each new day<br/>
							He will make a way, He will make a way<br/>
							<br/>
							With love and strength for each new day<br/>
							He will make a way, He will make a way<br/>
