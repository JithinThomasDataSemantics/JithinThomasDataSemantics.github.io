						Bind us together, Lord<br/>
						Bind us together<br/>
						With cords that cannot be broken<br/>
						Bind us together, Lord<br/>
						Bind us together<br/>
						Bind us together with love<br/>
						<br/>
						There is only one God<br/>
						There is only one King<br/>
						There is only one Body<br/>
						That is why we sing<br/>
						<br/>
						Made for the glory of God<br/>
						Purchased by His precious Son<br/>
						Born with the right to be clean<br/>
						For Jesus the victory has won<br/>
						<br/>
						You are the family of God<br/>
						You are the promise divine<br/>
						You are God's chosen desire<br/>
						You are the glorious new wine<br/>
