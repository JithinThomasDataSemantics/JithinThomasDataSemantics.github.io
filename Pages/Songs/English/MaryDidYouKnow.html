							Mary did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy <br/>
							Will one day walk on water?<br/>
							<br/>
							Mary did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy <br/>
							Will save our sons and daughters?<br/>
							<br/>
							Did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy<br/>
							Has come to make you new?<br/>
							This child that you've delivered, <br/>
							Will soon deliver you<br/>
							<br/>
							Mary did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy <br/>
							Will give sight to a blind man?<br/>
							Mary did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy <br/>
							Will calm a storm with his hand?<br/>
							Did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy <br/>
							Has walked where angels trod?<br/>
							And when you kiss your little baby, <br/>
							You have kissed the face of God<br/>
							<br/>
							Mary did you know, <br/>
							Mary did you know, <br/>
							Mary did you know<br/>
							<br/>
							The blind will see, <br/>
							The deaf will hear <br/>
							And the dead will live again<br/>
							<br/>
							The lame will leap, <br/>
							The dumb will speak, <br/>
							The praises of the lamb<br/>
							<br/>
							Mary did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy <br/>
							Is Lord of all creation?<br/>
							Mary did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy <br/>
							Will one day rule the nations?<br/>
							Did you know <br/>
							That your baby boy <br/>
							Is heaven's perfect Lamb?<br/>
							This sleeping child you're holding <br/>
							Is the great I am<br/>
							<br/>
							Mary did you know, <br/>
							Mary did you know, <br/>
							Mary did you know<br/>
