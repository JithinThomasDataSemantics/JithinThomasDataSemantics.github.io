							You alone are my strength, my shield<br/>
							To You alone may my spirit yield<br/>
							You alone are my heart's desire<br/>
							And I long to worship Thee<br/>
							<br/>
							As the deer panteth for the water<br/>
							So my soul longeth after Thee<br/>
							You alone are my heart's desire<br/>
							And I long to worship Thee<br/>
							<br/>
							You're my friend<br/>
							And You are my brother<br/>
							Even though You are a King<br/>
							I love You more than any other<br/>
							So much more than anything<br/>
							<br/>
							I want You more than gold or silver<br/>
							Only You can satisfy<br/>
							You alone are the real joy giver<br/>
							And the apple of my eye<br/>
