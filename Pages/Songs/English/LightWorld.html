							Light of the world, <br/>
							You step down into darkness.<br/>
							Open my eyes let me see.<br/>
							Beauty that made this heart adore you<br/>
							Hope of a life spent with you.<br/>
							<br/>
							Here I am to worship,<br/>
							Here I am to bow down,<br/>
							Here I am to say that you're my God,<br/>
							You're altogether lovely,<br/>
							Altogether worthy,<br/>
							Altogether wonderful to me, my love.<br/>
							<br/>
							King of all days,<br/>
							So highly exalted<br/>
							Glorious in heaven above.<br/>
							Humbly you came to the <br/>
							earth you created.<br/>
							All for love's sake became poor.<br/>
							<br/>
							So, here I am to worship,<br/>
							Here I am to bow down,<br/>
							Here I am to say that you're my God,<br/>
							You're altogether lovely,<br/>
							Altogether worthy,<br/>
							Altogether wonderful to me.<br/>
							<br/>
							I'll never know how much it cost<br/>
							To see my sin upon that cross.<br/>
							And I'll never know how much it cost<br/>
							To see my sin upon that cross.<br/>
							<br/>
							I'll never know how much it cost<br/>
							To see my sin upon that cross.<br/>
							I'll never know how much it cost<br/>
							To see my sin upon that cross.<br/>
							<br/>
							Here I am to worship,<br/>
							Here I am to bow down,<br/>
							Here I am to say that you're my God.<br/>
							You're altogether lovely,<br/>
							Altogether worthy,<br/>
							Altogether wonderful to me.<br/>
							<br/>
							So, here I am to worship,<br/>
							Here I am to bow down,<br/>
							Here I am to say that you're my God.<br/>
							You're altogether lovely,<br/>
							Altogether worthy,<br/>
							Altogether wonderful to me.<br/>
