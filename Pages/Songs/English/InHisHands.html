							All the tears of all of His children<br/>
							Just like the ocean our Father holds<br/>
							He sees the burdens<br/>
							He sees the struggles and every fear<br/>
							Even my own<br/>
							So many things I don't understand<br/>
							But He is God<br/>
							And He knows all of it<br/>
							<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							He is reaching out<br/>
							Let us run to Him<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							<br/>
							From the borders where the nations war<br/>
							To the battles inside our homes<br/>
							From the streets where the orphans cry<br/>
							To the loneliness inside our hearts<br/>
							In the place where I am<br/>
							Shore to shore<br/>
							Every land<br/>
							<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							He is reaching out<br/>
							Let us run to Him<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							<br/>
							He's got the whole world, whole world<br/>
							He's got the whole world, whole world<br/>
							He's got the whole world, whole world<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							<br/>
							From the moment when my mother died<br/>
							To the first breath of my baby boy<br/>
							I felt God<br/>
							He was with me then<br/>
							Through the heartache and in the joy<br/>
							Yes, every tear that we cry<br/>
							God is with us by our side<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							He is reaching out<br/>
							I'm gonna run to Him<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
							<br/>
							He's got the whole world, whole world<br/>
							He's got the whole world, whole world<br/>
							He's got the whole world, whole world<br/>
							He's got the whole world in His hands<br/>
