						I, the Lord of sea and sky<br/>
						I have heard my people cry<br/>
						All who dwell in dark and sin<br/>
						My hand will save.<br/>
						<br/>
						I who made the stars of night<br/>
						I will make the darkness bright<br/>
						Who will bear my light to them<br/>
						Whom shall I send?<br/>
						<br/>
						Here I am Lord<br/>
						Is it I Lord?<br/>
						I have heard you calling in the night<br/>
						I will go Lord<br/>
						If you lead me<br/>
						I will hold your people in my heart.<br/>
						<br/>
						I the Lord of snow and rain<br/>
						I have borne my people's pain<br/>
						I have wept for love of them<br/>
						They turn away.<br/>
						<br/>
						I will break their hearts of stone<br/>
						Fill their hearts with love alone<br/>
						I will speak my word to them<br/>
						Whom shall I send?<br/>
						<br/>
						Here I am Lord<br/>
						Is it I Lord?<br/>
						I have heard you calling in the night<br/>
						I will go Lord<br/>
						If you lead me<br/>
						I will hold your people in my heart.<br/>
						<br/>
						I will hold your people in my heart...<br/>
