							In the spirit<br/>
							We fall on our knees<br/>
							And our whole life<br/>
							We lay at Your feet<br/>
							In the spirit<br/>
							We fall on our knees<br/>
							And like David<br/>
							We rise up and dance<br/>
							Before you<br/>
							<br/>
							Take off your burdens, <br/>
							Take off your sorrows<br/>
							Put on your dancing shoes<br/>
							Take off your fears and <br/>
							Take off your pain<br/>
							Put on your robes of righteousness – lets groove it!<br/>
							<br/>
							Forever and ever <br/>
							And ever He will reign<br/>
							<br/>
							Take off your burdens, <br/>
							Take off your sorrows<br/>
							Put on your dancing shoes<br/>
							Take off your fears and <br/>
							Take off your pain<br/>
							Put on your robes of righteousness – groove it!<br/>
							<br/>
							Forever and ever <br/>
							And ever He will reign<br/>
							<br/>
							Back in the days of old<br/>
							To the end of the days we know<br/>
							You've send us a friend<br/>
							Who'll stay by us<br/>
							And lead us forevermore<br/>
							<br/>
							People of every kind<br/>
							Every nation and every land<br/>
							Will come to the Lord almighty <br/>
							Singing songs of praise<br/>
							Lord I believe the time is here<br/>
							The skies are ablaze, <br/>
							The sign is clear<br/>
							No eye can see it, <br/>
							Who can conceive it?<br/>
							Your holy spirit's like a <br/>
							Fire in my soul<br/>
							<br/>
							In the spirit<br/>
							We fall on our knees<br/>
							And our whole life<br/>
							We lay at Your feet<br/>
							In the spirit<br/>
							We fall on our knees<br/>
							And like David<br/>
							We rise up and dance<br/>
							Before you<br/>
							<br/>
							Forever and ever <br/>
							And ever He will reign<br/>
