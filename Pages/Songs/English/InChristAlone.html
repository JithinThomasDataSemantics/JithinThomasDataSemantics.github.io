						<br/>
						In Christ alone my hope is found<br/>
						He is my light, my strength, my song<br/>
						This Cornerstone, this solid ground<br/>
						Firm through the fiercest drought and storm<br/>
						What heights of love, what depths of peace<br/>
						When fears are stilled, when strivings cease<br/>
						My Comforter, my All in All<br/>
						Here in the love of Christ I stand<br/>
						<br/>
						In Christ alone, who took on flesh<br/>
						Fullness of God in helpless babe<br/>
						This gift of love and righteousness<br/>
						Scorned by the ones He came to save<br/>
						'Til on that cross as Jesus died<br/>
						The wrath of God was satisfied<br/>
						For every sin on Him was laid<br/>
						Here in the death of Christ I live, I live<br/>
						<br/>
						There in the ground His body lay<br/>
						Light of the world by darkness slain<br/>
						Then bursting forth in glorious Day<br/>
						Up from the grave He rose again<br/>
						And as He stands in victory<br/>
						Sin's curse has lost its grip on me<br/>
						For I am His and He is mine<br/>
						Bought with the precious blood of Christ<br/>
						<br/>
						No guilt in life, no fear in death<br/>
						This is the power of Christ in me<br/>
						From life's first cry to final breath<br/>
						Jesus commands my destiny<br/>
						No power of hell, no scheme of man<br/>
						Can ever pluck me from His hand<br/>
						Till He returns or calls me home<br/>
						Here in the power of Christ I'll stand<br/>
						<br/>
						I will stand<br/>
						I will stand, all other ground is sinking sand<br/>
						All other ground, all other ground<br/>
						Is sinking sand, is sinking sand<br/>
						So I'll stand<br/>
