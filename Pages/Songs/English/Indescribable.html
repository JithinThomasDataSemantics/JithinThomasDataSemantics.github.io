							From the highest of heights <br/>
							To the depths of the sea<br/>
							Creation's revealing Your majesty<br/>
							From the colors of fall <br/>
							To the fragrance of spring<br/>
							Every creature unique in <br/>
							The song that it sings<br/>
							All exclaiming<br/>
							<br/>
							Indescribable, uncontainable,<br/>
							You placed the stars in the sky<br/>
							And You know them by name.<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							All powerful, untameable,<br/>
							Awestruck we fall to our knees <br/>
							As we humbly proclaim<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							<br/>
							Who has told every lightning bolt <br/>
							Where it should go<br/>
							Or seen heavenly storehouses <br/>
							Laden with snow<br/>
							Who imagined the sun and gives <br/>
							Source to its light<br/>
							Yet conceals it to bring us the <br/>
							Coolness of night<br/>
							None can fathom<br/>
							<br/>
							Indescribable, uncontainable,<br/>
							You placed the stars in the sky<br/>
							And You know them by name<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							All powerful, untameable,<br/>
							Awestruck we fall to our knees <br/>
							As we humbly proclaim<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							<br/>
							Indescribable, uncontainable,<br/>
							You placed the stars in the sky <br/>
							And You know them by name.<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							All powerful, untameable,<br/>
							Awestruck we fall to our knees <br/>
							As we humbly proclaim<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							<br/>
							Indescribable, uncontainable,<br/>
							You placed the stars in the sky <br/>
							And You know them by name.<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							Incomparable, unchangeable<br/>
							You see the depths of my heart <br/>
							And You love me the same<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
							You are amazing God<br/>
