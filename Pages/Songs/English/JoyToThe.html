						Joy to the world! the Lord is come;<br/>
						Let earth receive her King;<br/>
						Let every heart prepare Him room,<br/>
						And heaven and nature sing,<br/>
						And heaven and nature sing,<br/>
						And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.<br/>
						<br/>
						Joy to the earth! the Savior reigns;<br/>
						Let men their songs employ;<br/>
						While fields and floods,<br/>
						Rocks, hills and plains<br/>
						Repeat the sounding joy,<br/>
						Repeat the sounding joy,<br/>
						Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.<br/>
						<br/>
						No more let sins and sorrows grow,<br/>
						Nor thorns infest the ground;<br/>
						He comes to make His blessing flow<br/>
						Far as the curse is found,<br/>
						Far as the curse is found,<br/>
						Far as, far as the curse is found.<br/>
						<br/>
						He rules the world with truth and grace,<br/>
						And makes the nations prove<br/>
						The glories of His righteousness,<br/>
						And wonders of His love,<br/>
						And wonders of His love,<br/>
						And wonders, wonders of His love.<br/>
