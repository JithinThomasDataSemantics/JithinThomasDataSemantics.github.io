							When He rolls up His sleeves<br/>
							He ain't just puttin' on the Ritz<br/>
							(Our God is an Awesome God)<br/>
							There is thunder in His footsteps<br/>
							And lightning in His fists<br/>
							(Our God is an Awesome God)<br/>
							<br/>
							Well the Lord He wasn't jokin'<br/>
							When He kicked 'em out of Eden<br/>
							It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood<br/>
							His return is very close and so you better be believin'<br/>
							That our God is an Awesome God<br/>
							<br/>
							Our God  is an Awesome God<br/>
							He reigns  from heaven above<br/>
							With wisdom  power and love<br/>
							Our God is an Awesome God(2)<br/>
							<br/>
							When the sky was starless in the void of the night<br/>
							(our God is an awesome God)<br/>
							He spoke into the darkness and created the light<br/>
							(our God is an awesome God)<br/>
							<br/>
							Judgement and wrath He poured out the Sodom<br/>
							Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross<br/>
							I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that<br/>
							Our God is an Awesome God<br/>
							<br/>
							Our God  is an Awesome God<br/>
							He reigns  from heaven above<br/>
							With wisdom  power and love<br/>
							Our God is an Awesome God(3)<br/>
