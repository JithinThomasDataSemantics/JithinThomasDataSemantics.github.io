							Dashing through the snow, <br/>
							In a one-horse open sleigh,<br/>
							Over the fields we go, <br/>
							Laughing all the way.<br/>
							Bells on bob-tails ring, <br/>
							Making spirits bright,<br/>
							What fun it is to ride and <br/>
							Sing a sleighing song tonight.<br/>
							<br/>
							Jingle bells, jingle bells, <br/>
							Jingle all the way!<br/>
							O what fun it is to ride <br/>
							In a one-horse open sleigh.(2)<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							A day or two ago, <br/>
							I thought I'd take a ride<br/>
							And soon Miss Fanny Bright, <br/>
							Was seated by my side;<br/>
							The horse was lean and lank, <br/>
							Misfortune seemed his lot;<br/>
							He got into a drifted <br/>
							Bank and we got upsot<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Jingle bells, jingle bells, <br/>
							Jingle all the way!<br/>
							O what fun it is to ride <br/>
							In a one-horse open sleigh.(2)<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							A day or two ago, <br/>
							The story I must tell<br/>
							I went out on the snow, <br/>
							And on my back I fell;<br/>
							A gent was riding by, <br/>
							In a one-horse open sleigh<br/>
							He laughed as there I sprawling <br/>
							Lie but quickly drove away<br/>
							<br/>
							Jingle bells, jingle bells, <br/>
							Jingle all the way!<br/>
							O what fun it is to ride <br/>
							In a one-horse open sleigh.(2)<br/>
							<br/>
							Now the ground is white,<br/>
							Go it while you're young<br/>
							Take the girls tonight, <br/>
							And sing this sleighing song;<br/>
							Just get a bob-tailed bay, <br/>
							Two-forty as his speed<br/>
							Hitch him to an open sleigh and<br/>
							Crack! you'll take the lead <br/>
							<br/>
							Jingle bells, jingle bells, <br/>
							Jingle all the way!<br/>
							O what fun it is to ride <br/>
							In a one-horse open sleigh.(2)<br/>
