						Once in royal David's city<br/>
						Stood a lowly cattle shed<br/>
						There a mother laid her baby<br/>
						In a manger for His bed<br/>
						Mary was that mother mild<br/>
						Jesus Christ her little child<br/>
						<br/>
						He came down to earth from heaven<br/>
						Who is God and Lord of all<br/>
						And His shelter was a stable<br/>
						And His cradle was a stall<br/>
						With the poor, oppressed and wholly<br/>
						Lived on earth our Savior holy<br/>
						<br/>
						And our eyes<br/>
						At last shall see Him<br/>
						Through His own redeeming love<br/>
						For that child, so dear and gentle<br/>
						Is our Lord in heaven above<br/>
						And He leads His children along<br/>
						To the place that He is gone<br/>
