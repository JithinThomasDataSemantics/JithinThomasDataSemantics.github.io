							Glory to the Father ,<br/>
							Sing glory to the Son,<br/>
							Glory to the Spirit,<br/>
							Glory, glory everyone,<br/>
							Glory on the earth He made it,<br/>
							Glory up above,<br/>
							Glory, glory everybody,<br/>
							We have seen a Father's love.<br/>
							Give thanks to the Lord for He is good,<br/>
							And make music-for our God on high,<br/>
							For He guides us every day,<br/>
							And He watches through the night;<br/>
							Let us praise Him as we sing together,<br/>
							Holy God of light Your works,<br/>
							O Lord have made us glad;<br/>
							For a Father's help we shout to you with joy:<br/>
							Oh, how great are the deeds<br/>
							You have worked upon the land<br/>
							But the foolish will never see them,<br/>
							He can't understand.<br/>
