							Hold on to Jesus<br/>
							And tell Him about everything<br/>
							Your dreams and your troubles<br/>
							Pure hearts desire one thing<br/>
							<br/>
							And mine is to know You<br/>
							Mine is to break down<br/>
							And shatter to pieces<br/>
							And lose everything I've found<br/>
							<br/>
							I'm learning that nothing worth anything is cheap<br/>
							I'm learning the path is thin and the grade is steep<br/>
							And that the altars where we lay ourselves will crack when tested<br/>
							And that there's only one that turns our hearts to gold<br/>
							<br/>
							Hold on to Jesus<br/>
							Tell him about everything<br/>
							Your dreams and your troubles<br/>
							Pure hearts desire one thing<br/>
							<br/>
							And mine is to know You<br/>
							Mine is to break down<br/>
							And shatter to pieces<br/>
							And lose everything I've found<br/>
							<br/>
							I'm finding that I'm not who I once thought I was<br/>
							I'm finding I'm powerless to obtain Your love<br/>
							And that the only gifts I bring to You are rags and failures<br/>
							Through a strange exchange You've made them myrrh and gold<br/>
							<br/>
							Hold on to Jesus<br/>
							Tell Him about everything<br/>
							Your dreams and your troubles<br/>
							Pure hearts desire one thing<br/>
