							I lay my life down at Your feet<br/>
							Cause You're the only one I need<br/>
							I turn to You and You are always there<br/>
							<br/>
							In troubled times it's You I seek<br/>
							I put You first that's all I need<br/>
							I humble all I am all to You<br/>
							<br/>
							One way, Jesus<br/>
							You're the only one that I could live for<br/>
							One Way, Jesus<br/>
							You're the only one that I could live for<br/>
							<br/>
							You are always, always there<br/>
							Every how and everywhere<br/>
							Your grace abounds so deeply within me<br/>
							<br/>
							You will never ever change<br/>
							Yesterday today the same<br/>
							Forever till forever meets no end<br/>
							<br/>
							One way, Jesus<br/>
							You're the only one that I could live for<br/>
							One Way, Jesus<br/>
							You're the only one that I could live for<br/>
							<br/>
							You are the Way the Truth and the Life<br/>
							We live by faith and not by sight for You<br/>
							We're living all for You<br/>
