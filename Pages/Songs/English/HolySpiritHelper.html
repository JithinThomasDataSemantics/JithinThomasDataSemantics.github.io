							Oh Spirit of the living God<br/>
							My helper, My comfort<br/>
							You are always by my side...<br/>
							<br/>
							The Spirit is my helper<br/>
							Now and forever<br/>
							The one who is always by my side.<br/>
							The Holy Spirit is my helper<br/>
							Now and forever<br/>
							The one who is always by my side.<br/>
							<br/>
							He strengthens me when I’m weak and worn<br/>
							Takes away from me desires of this world<br/>
							He teaches me to love and forgive<br/>
							Shows me how to pray and fills me with the word<br/>
							The mysteries of God He makes known to me<br/>
							The truth now I’m able to see<br/>
							Wisdom and counsel He gives to me<br/>
							And fills me with power from above.<br/>
							<br/>
							The Spirit is my helper<br/>
							Now and forever<br/>
							The one who is always by my side.<br/>
							The Holy Spirit is my helper<br/>
							Now and forever<br/>
							The one who is always by my side.<br/>
							<br/>
							He gives me strength me when I’m weak and worn<br/>
							Takes away from me desires of this world<br/>
							He teaches me to love and forgive<br/>
							Shows me how to pray and fills me with the word<br/>
							The mysteries of God He makes known to me<br/>
							The truth now I’m able to see<br/>
							Wisdom and counsel He gives to me<br/>
							And fills me with power from above.<br/>
							<br/>
							The Spirit is my helper<br/>
							Now and forever<br/>
							The one who is always by my side.<br/>
							The Holy Spirit is my helper<br/>
							Now and forever<br/>
							The one who is always by my side [8]<br/>
