						<br/>
							In bread we bring you Lord, <br/>
							Our body's' labour<br/>
							In wine we offer you <br/>
							Our spirit's grief.<br/>
							We do not ask you, Lord, <br/>
							Who is my neighbor?<br/>
							But stand united now, <br/>
							In one belief.<br/>
							For we have gladly heard your Word, <br/>
							Your holy Word<br/>
							And now in answer, Lord, <br/>
							Our gifts we bring.<br/>
							Our selfish hearts make true, <br/>
							Our failing faith renew, <br/>
							Our life belongs to you,<br/>
							Our Lord and King.<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							The bread we offer you is <br/>
							Blessed and broken, <br/>
							And it becomes for us <br/>
							Our spirit's food.<br/>
							Over the cup we bring, <br/>
							Your Word is spoken;<br/>
							Make it your gift to us, <br/>
							Your healing blood.<br/>
							Take all that daily toil, <br/>
							Plants in our heart's poor soil, <br/>
							Take all we start and spoil, <br/>
							Each hopeful dream.<br/>
							The chances we have missed, <br/>
							The graces we resist, <br/>
							Lord, in thy Eucharist, take and redeem.<br/>
