						Come, now is the time to worship<br/>
						Come, now is the time to give your heart<br/>
						Come, just as you are to worship<br/>
						Come, just as you are before your God<br/>
						Come<br/>
						<br/>
						One day every tongue will confess You are God<br/>
						One day every knee will bow<br/>
						Still, the greatest treasure remains for those<br/>
						Who gladly choose You now<br/>
