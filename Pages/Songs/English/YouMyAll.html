							You are my strength when I am weak<br/>
							You are the treasure that I seek<br/>
							You are my all in all<br/>
							Seeking You as a precious jewel<br/>
							Lord, to give up I'd be a fool<br/>
							You are my all in all<br/>

							Jesus, Lamb of God<br/>
							Worthy is Your name<br/>
							Jesus, Lamb of God<br/>
							Worthy is Your name<br/>
							<br/>
							Taking my sin, my cross, my shame<br/>
							Rising again I bless Your name<br/>
							You are my all in all<br/>
							When I fall down You pick me up<br/>
							When I am dry You fill my cup<br/>
							You are my all in all<br/>
							<br/>
							Jesus, Lamb of God<br/>
							Worthy is Your name<br/>
							Jesus, Lamb of God<br/>
							Worthy is Your name<br/>

							Oh my<br/>
							Jesus, Lamb of God<br/>
							Worthy is Your name<br/>
