							I was takin a trip <br/>
							On a plane the other day<br/>
							Just wishing that I could get out.<br/>
							When the man next to me <br/>
							Saw the book in my hand<br/>
							And asked me what it was about.<br/>
							So I settled back in my seat-<br/>
							"A best seller," I said.<br/>
							"A history, a mystery in one."<br/>
							And then I opened up the book <br/>
							And began to read<br/>
							From Matthew, Mark, <br/>
							Luke, and John.<br/>
							<br/>
							He was born of a virgin <br/>
							One holy night<br/>
							In the little town of Bethlehem.<br/>
							Angels gathered round him <br/>
							Underneath the stars singing <br/>
							Praises to the great I Am.<br/>
							He walked on the water, <br/>
							Healed the lame <br/>
							And made the blind to see again.<br/>
							And for the first time here on earth <br/>
							We learned that <br/>
							God could be a friend.<br/>
							And though he never ever did <br/>
							A single thing wrong<br/>
							The angry crowd chose him. <br/>
							And then he walked down the road<br/>
							And died on the cross <br/>
							And that was the end of the beginning.<br/>
							<br/>
							"Thats not a new book <br/>
							Thats a bible," he said, <br/>
							"and I've heard it all before.<br/>
							I've tried religion- <br/>
							Its shame and guilt <br/>
							And I dont need it anymore.<br/>
							It's superstition, <br/>
							Made up tales <br/>
							And just to help the weak to survive."<br/>
							"Let me read it again," I said, <br/>
							"listen closely, cuz this is gonna change your life.<br/>
							<br/>
							He was born of a virgin <br/>
							One holy night<br/>
							In the little town of Bethlehem.<br/>
							Angels gathered round him <br/>
							Underneath the stars singing <br/>
							Praises to the great I Am.<br/>
							He walked on the water, <br/>
							Healed the lame <br/>
							And made the blind to see again.<br/>
							And for the first time here on earth <br/>
							We learned that <br/>
							God could be a friend.<br/>
							And though he never ever did <br/>
							A single thing wrong<br/>
							The angry crowd chose him. <br/>
							And then he walked down the road<br/>
							And died on the cross <br/>
							And that was the end of the beginning.<br/><br/>
							"The end of the beginning," <br/>
							He said with a smile.<br/>
							"What more could there be? He's dead.<br/>
							You said they hung him, <br/>
							Put nails in His hands<br/>
							And a crown of thorns on His head."<br/>
							I said, "I'll read it again <br/>
							But this time there's more,<br/>
							And I believe that this is true.<br/>
							His death wasn't the end, <br/>
							The beginning of life<br/>
							That's completed in you.<br/>
							Don't you see he did all this for you!"<br/>
							<br/>
							He was born of a virgin <br/>
							One holy night<br/>
							In the little town of Bethlehem<br/>
							All the angles singing <br/>
							Praises to the great I AM<br/>
							He walked on the water, <br/>
							Healed the lame,<br/>
							And made the blind to see(eee)<br/>
							(and for the first time here on earth)<br/>
							Did you know that <br/>
							God could be a friend.<br/>
							Tho He never ever did a single thing wrong,<br/>
							He was the one the crowd chose.<br/>
							Then he walked <br/>
							And he died but<br/>
							Three days later (3) <br/>
							HE ROSE!!!!!!!!<br/>
							<br/>
							Three days later he rose!<br/>
							You see he came, he lived, and he died.<br/>
							But that was the end of the beginning.<br/>
