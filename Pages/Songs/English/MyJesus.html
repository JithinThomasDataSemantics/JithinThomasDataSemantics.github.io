							The wonders of Your mighty love.<br/>

							Let every breath,<br/>

							all the earth let us sing,<br/>
							Power and majesty, <br/>
							praise to the King!<br/>
							Mountains bow down <br/>
							and the seas will roar,<br/>
							At the sound of your name!<br/>
							<br/>
							I sing for joy at the <br/>
							work of your hands,<br/>
							Forever I'll love you, <br/>
							forever I'll stand<br/>
							Nothing compares to the <br/>
							promise I have in You.<br/>
