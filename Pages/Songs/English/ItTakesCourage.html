						It takes courage to answer a call,<br/>
						It takes courage to give your all,<br/>
						It takes courage to risk your name<br/>
						It takes courage to be true,<br/>
						<br/>
						It takes courage to dare What no other will share,<br/>
						To be standing alone, One whom no one will own,<br/>
						To be ready to stake for another man's sake.<br/>
						It takes courage to be true.<br/>
						<br/>
						It takes courage to say what you know will not pay.<br/>
						To give each one his share though there'll be less to<br/>
						spare.<br/>
						To be seeking no more than the neighbour next door.<br/>
						It takes courage to be true.<br/>
						<br/>
						It takes courage to leave what good fortune can give,<br/>
						And to go to a land where the poor need a hand;<br/>
						To be spending one's days in less leisurely ways.<br/>
						It takes courage to be true.<br/>
