						Bless the Lord oh my soul<br/>
						Oh my soul<br/>
						Worship His Holy name<br/>
						Sing like never before<br/>
						Oh my soul<br/>
						I'll worship Your Holy name<br/>
						<br/>
						The sun comes up<br/>
						It's a new day dawning<br/>
						It's time to sing Your song again<br/>
						Whatever may pass<br/>
						And whatever lies before me<br/>
						Let me be singing<br/>
						When the evening comes<br/>
						<br/>
						You're rich in love<br/>
						And You're slow to anger<br/>
						Your name is great<br/>
						And Your heart is kind<br/>
						For all Your goodness<br/>
						I will keep on singing<br/>
						Ten thousand reasons<br/>
						For my heart to find <br/>
						<br/>
						And on that day<br/>
						When my strength is failing<br/>
						The end draws near<br/>
						And my time has come<br/>
						Still my soul will<br/>
						Sing Your praise unending<br/>
						Ten thousand years<br/>
						And then forevermore<br/>
						Forevermore<br/>
						<br/>
						Bless the Lord oh my soul<br/>
						Oh my soul<br/>
						Worship His Holy name<br/>
						Sing like never before<br/>
						Oh my soul<br/>
						I'll worship Your Holy name(2)<br/>
						Yes I'll worship Your Holy name<br/>
						Lord I'll worship Your Holy name<br/>
