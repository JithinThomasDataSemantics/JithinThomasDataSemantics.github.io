					I love the thrill that I <br/>
					Feel when I get together with<br/>
					God's wonderful people<br/>
					Love the thrill that I <br/>
					Feel when I get together with<br/>
					God's wonderful people<br/><br/>

					What a sight to see all the happy faces<br/>
					Praising God in the heavenly places<br/>
					Love the thrill that I <br/>
					Feel when I get together with<br/>
					God's wonderful people.<br/><br/>

					<em>Now it can be just anywhere <br/>
					Two or three are gathered there <br/>
					That the spirit of the Lord will be there too <br/>
					There's no fellowship so sweet <br/>
					There's no thrill that can compete <br/>
					With the thrill I feel whenever God's children meet <br/><br/>

					And on that great reunion day <br/>
					When our Lord says, "Come away" <br/>
					And the saints from every land stream through the gate <br/>
					Joining loved ones round the throne <br/>
					At last we'll all be gathered home <br/>
					That will be the greatest thrill we've ever known<em><br/><br/><br/>
