					Don't want to stand here and shout Your praise<br/>
					And walk away and forget Your Name<br/>
					I'll stand for you if it's all I do<br/>
					'Cause there is none that compare to You<br/><br/>

					'Cause all I want in this lifetime is You<br/>
					And all i want in this whole world is you you you<br/><br/>

					Tell the world that Jesus lives<br/>
					Tell the world that, tell the world that<br/>
					Tell the world that he died for them<br/>
					Tell the world that he lives again<br/><br/>

					No longer I but Christ in me<br/>
					'Cause it's the truth that set me free<br/>
					How could this world be a better place?<br/>
					But by thy mercy and by thy grace<br/><br/>

					C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You<br/>
					C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You<br/><br/>

					Tell the world that Jesus lives<br/>
					Tell the world that, tell the world that<br/>
					Tell the world that he died for them<br/>
					Tell the world that he lives again<br/><br/>

					C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You<br/>
					Tell the world that<br/>
					Tell the world that<br/>
					C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You<br/>
					Tell the world that<br/>
					Tell the world that<br/>
					About You<br/><br/><br/>
