					When you're jumping, <br/>
					Jumping up and down<br/>
					When you're spinning, <br/>
					Spinning round and round<br/>
					God's seeing everything you do<br/>
					He's watching, watching over you<br/><br/>

					Hey<br/>
					God is watching, watching over you,<br/>
					24/7 watching over you<br/>
					Your life is in His hands ooh ooh <br/>
					He's got great big plans <br/>
					Cos He's watching over you<br/><br/>

					When you're waving, <br/>
					Your hands up in the air<br/>
					When you're shouting, <br/>
					No matter when or where<br/>
					God's seeing everything you do<br/>
					He's watching, watching over you<br/><br/>

					God is watching, watching over you,<br/>
