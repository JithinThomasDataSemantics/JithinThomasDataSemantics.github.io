					Saint Corbinian was an 8th century Frank who was renowned for his holiness. While traveling to Rome on a pilgrimage in honor of Saint Peter, a bear ate his pack horse. The saint commanded 
					the bear to accept the load in its stead, which it miraculously did. Upon arrival in Rome, the saint released the bear and it lumbered off into the forest.

					Pope Gregory II recognized in Saint Corbinian just the kind of man to evangelize the Germans. (After all, he had tamed a bear!) So the saint was dispatched to the wilds of Bavaria. The 
					local warlord was in an incestuous marriage, which Saint Corbinian condemned. This enraged the warlord's wife, who sought the holy bishop's life. (That bear would have come in handy.) 
					While Saint Corbinian was in exile, the warlord was killed in battle and his wicked wife was carried off, never to be heard from again.

					Saint Corbinian returned and established a Benedictine monastery. He died in 730, and his feast day is September 8.

					The bear appeared on Pope Benedict's coat of arms. He saw in the figure of the burdened bear his own acceptance of onerous ecclesiastical duties. Like Saint Corbinian's bear, he was 
					permitted to lay his burdens down.
