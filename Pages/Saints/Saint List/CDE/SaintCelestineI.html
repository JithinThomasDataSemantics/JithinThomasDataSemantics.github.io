					Saint Celestine was born in Rome. In the year 422, Celestine was chosen to succeed Pope Saint Boniface, and was known as Pope Celestine I.
				</p>
				<p>
					 He wrote to the bishops of the provinces of Vienne and Narbonne in Gaulto correct several abuses which had followed upon errors in doctrine.  He stipulated, among other things, that 
					absolution or reconciliation should never be refused to any dying sinner who sincerely asked for it; as repentance depends not so much on time as on the heart, which can be changed in 
					a moment when God so wills.  Saint Celestine assembled a synod at Rome in the year 430, by which the writings of Nestorius were examined, and the heresiarch's obstinate errors in 
					maintaining in Christ two persons, a divine and a human, were condemned. The Pope pronounced sentence of excommunication against Nestorius, and deposed him. Pope Celestine I sent Saint 
					Germanus of Auxerre to Great Britain where the seeds of Pelagian heresy, denying the necessity of grace, were spreading. Saint Germanus was successful by his zeal and ministry in 
					preventing that danger from spreading.  Pope Celestine sent Saint Palladius, a Roman, to preach the Faith to  the Scots, both in North Britain and in Ireland.
				</p>
				<p>
					This holy Pope died on the 1st of August in the year 432, having reigned almost ten years.
