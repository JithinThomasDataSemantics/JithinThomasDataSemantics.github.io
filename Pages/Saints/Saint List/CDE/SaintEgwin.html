					Benedictine bishops who established monasteries in medieval England.
				</p>
				<p>
					Born of royal blood in the 7th century, Egwin entered a monastery and was enthusiastically received by royalty, clergy and the people as the bishop of Worcester, England. As a bishop he 
					was known as a protector of orphans and the widowed and a fair judge. Who could argue with that?
				</p>
				<p>
					His popularity didn't hold up among members of the clergy, however. They saw him as overly strict, while he felt he was simply trying to correct abuses and impose appropriate 
					disciplines. Bitter resentments arose, and Egwin made his way to Rome to present his case to Pope Constantine. The case against Egwin was examined and annulled.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon his return to England, he founded Evesham Abbey, which became one of the great Benedictine houses of medieval England. It was dedicated to Mary, who had reportedly made it known to 
					Egwin just where a church should be built in her honor.
				</p>
				<p>
					He died at the abbey on December 30, in the year 717. Following his burial many miracles were attributed to him: The blind could see, the deaf could hear, the sick were healed.
