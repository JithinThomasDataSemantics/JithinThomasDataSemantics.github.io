					One account of Eurosia's reports that she was a Christian living in Spain after the conquest by the Moors. Having been betrothed against her will to a Moor, she fled and hid in a cave. 
					A search party discovered her by following the smell of woodsmoke. They then dragged her out of the cave by her hair and beheaded her.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another account says that she was a Bohemian aristocrat, pagan in her early years, but orphaned, adopted, and converted by Ludmila, wife of Duke Borivoj. Saint Methodius, who had been 
					instrumental in keeping Borijov on his throne, needed to find a royal wife for a Spanish prince -- the Pope himself had assigned this matchmaking mission to Methodius. Eurosia was 
					selected, and at age sixteen, packed off to Pamplona.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get to Pamplona, they had to cross through a war zone. The Moorish captain, Aben Lupo, attacked the party, took her prisoner, and intended to wed her himself. She escaped, but was 
					tracked down. Eurosia sought support from heaven, and lightning struck nearby, but the Moors were not dissuaded. They beheaded and dismembered her. After this, foul weather and 
					lightning plagued the Moors all the way back to their camp.
