				<p>
					Son of Saint Gwynllyw, a king in Wales, a robber chieftain who led a band of 300; his mother, Saint Gladys, had been stolen in a raid on a neighboring chief; brother of Saint Gluvias. 
					Raised by an Irish monk; Cadoc's father had stolen the monk's cow, and when he came to demand its return, the king decided it was sign. Studied in Wales and Ireland. Priest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once chased through a wood by an armed swineherd from an enemy tribe. His hiding place spooked an old, gray, wild boar that made three great leaps at him - then disappeared; Cadoc took 
					this as a sign, and the location became the site of the great church and monastery at Llancarvan, Wales; the house became renowned for the learning and holiness of its monks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Legend says he once saved his brother monks in a famine by tying a white thread to the foot of a (well-fed) mouse; he then following the thread to an abandoned, well-stocked, 
					underground granary. Another time he and his brothers went out to meet a band of thieves, chanting and playing harps; it surprised the highwaymen so much, they turned and left.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lived as a hermit with Saint Gildas on the Island of Flatholmes off Vannes, Brittany. Established a monastery on a small island just off Brittany, joined by a stone bridge so local 
					children could walk out for school. Returned to Britain to evangelize, and work with Christian survivors of Saxon raids. Martyr.
