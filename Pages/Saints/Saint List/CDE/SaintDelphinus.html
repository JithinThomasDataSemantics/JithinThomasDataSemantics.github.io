					Very little is known of St. Delphinus, before he was elevated to the episcopate.  We do know that he was the Bishop of Bordeaux, France.  We also know that he baptized St. Paulinus of 
					Nola, whose Epistles addressed to St. Delphinus are very thankful, in their expressions of gratitude and veneration.  We also know that St. Delphinus assisted at the Spanish Council of 
					Saragossa in 380.  Its main purpose was to discuss the Priscillianist heretics, whom later he again condemned in a Synod of his own in 385.  According to records, we know that he 
					corresponded with St. Ambrose, and there was a friendship between the two.  We also know that he died on December 24th, 403.

					In explaining the origin of Feast Days, most Saints have specially designated feast days and are associated with a specific day of the year and these are referred to as the Saints Feast 
					Day.  The Feast Days first arose from the very early Christian custom of the annual commemoration of martyrs on the dates of their deaths at the same time celebrating their birth into 
					heaven.  The feast day for St. Delphinus is celebrated on the date of his death and birth into heaven, December 24th.
