					Born into a noble family in Aix (Provence), Saint Eugene spent part of his childhood in Italy because of the French Revolution. Ordained a priest at Amiens in 1811, he soon organized 
					missionaries to go to rural parts of Provence, instructing the people whose religious training had been disrupted for many years by the French Revolution and its aftermath.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eugene began the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in 1816, obtaining papal approval for them 10 years later. From rural preaching, they soon moved into running seminaries to 
					improve the quality of the clergy. Their first foreign mission was in Canada in 1841; soon they were in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Latin America.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1851, Eugene followed his uncle as archbishop of Marseilles where he died 10 years later. He had focused his energies on Church renewal and reform while vigorously defending the 
					Church's right to spread the Good News.
				</p>
				<p>
					His congregation has grown to become one of the largest in the Church, serving in over 50 countries, especially in northern and western Canada. Many of its members have become 
					missionary bishops.
				</p>
				<p>
					At Eugene's canonization in 1998, Pope John Paul II praised his vision, perseverance, and conformity to God's will.
