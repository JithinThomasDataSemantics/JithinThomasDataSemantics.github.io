					St. Dismas was the good thief who was crucified with Jesus.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only substantial record we have of this man comes from the Gospel of Luke (other Gospels note that Jesus was crucified between two revolutionaries, but do not elaborate). As Luke 
					tells us, Jesus was crucified with two thieves. As the three condemned were dying, one taunted Jesus along with the crowd, telling him, "Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us." 
				</p>
				<p>
					The other thief rebuked him, saying, "Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation? And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received 
					corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal." Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."Jesus told him, "This day you will be with me in 
					paradise" (Luke 23:43).
				</p>
				<p>
					The Christian community took seriously Jesus' words here that this good thief was saved, and honors him as a saint. Dismas' response to Jesus is a good articulation of steps in 
					conversion away from sin: he came to an honest awareness of his sin and turned away from it, seeking Jesus as the source of eternal life. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Like other personalities close to the story of Jesus, we know little about Dismas. The Christian community constructed a story to fill in this gap, including his nameâ€”in some 
					traditions, he is known as Titus or Zoathan. The most popular name, Dismas, was adopted from the Greek word for "sunset" or "death," and began to be used in stories dating from the 
					fourth century. One legend says that Dismas and his fellow thief held up Joseph and Mary when they were fleeing to Egypt with the child Jesus. Dismas is said to have been moved to 
					compassion and bribed his companion to let the Holy Family pass safely.
				</p>
				<p>
					The relics of St. Dismas rest in the reliquary chapel, including a piece of Dismas' cross. His image is used here with permission from Catholic.org.

				<p>
					The Dismas House in South Bend is named after this good thief, and is a halfway house for men recently released from jail. The house is a community partner with the Center for Social 
					Concerns, and Notre Dame students volunteer there to support former prisoners who are adjusting to life after incarceration.
