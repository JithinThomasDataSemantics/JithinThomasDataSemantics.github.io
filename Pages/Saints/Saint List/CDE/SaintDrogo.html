					Drogo was born sometime in the first two decades of the twelfth century. His wealthy (perhaps noble) parents lived in the village of Epinoy, now part of Carvin in the extreme north of 
					France near Flanders. His father died before Drogo was born. His mother suffered such complications in labor that it was necessary to deliver the baby by Caesarian section, and she died 
					bringing her son into the world. The newborn, an orphan from birth, was left to the care of relatives and baptized Drogo (Druon in French).
				</p>
				<p>
					When Drogo was about ten, he learned the circumstances of his mother's death. A sensitive soul, Drogo was deeply touched by accounts of her suffering, and afterwards was often seen to 
					weep bitterly for her. Indeed, in his innocent simplicity, young Drogo reproached himself for what seemed a grave offense, and implored God's pardon with great contrition. Even as a boy 
					he practiced fasting, abstinence and other austerities, and devoted himself to works of charity in expiation of his faults.
				</p>
				<p>
					As Drogo approached manhood, he resolved to abandon his home and distribute his considerable inheritance to the poor. Whatever circumstances precipitated this sudden change, we may well 
					imagine that Drogo was inspired by Christ's exhortation to another troubled young man: "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have 
					treasure in heaven: and come follow me" (Mt 19:21). Drogo kept for himself no more than the clothes on his back, and entrusting himself to Providence, he took to the open road, never to 
					return to his birthplace.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a time, Drogo's wanderings brought him to the small village of Sebourg, some 35 miles from Epinoy. Now just on the French side of the modern Franco-Belgian frontier, Sebourg was 
					in those days part of the County of Hainaut, an independent territory bordering on France. There, Drogo found employment tending sheep in the service of a pious, well-off peasant woman, 
					a largely solitary occupation that suited his temperament and spiritual bent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The humble austerity of shepherds' lives belied the valuable role they played in twelfth-century European society. Sheep husbandry supplied wool to support a booming international 
					textile trade and parchment to satisfy the demands of rising book production. Moreover, shepherds were skilled and knowledgeable laborers. A 1379 treatise by Jean de Brie, The True 
					Order and Government of Shepherds and Shepherdesses, reveals that medieval shepherds mastered how to attend to the varying needs of the flock in each month of the year; to treat and 
					prevent the illnesses and injuries to which sheep are prone; to predict the weather by the observation of wind, sky and wildlife; to recognize harmful and salutary plants; and to use 
					expertly the various accoutrements of their art. De Brie's treatise also reveals the sense of inherent dignity that medieval shepherds attached to their calling, which they saw affirmed 
					throughout Scripture from the pleasing sacrifice of the first shepherd Abel to the honor that God bestowed on the shepherds outside Bethlehem.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following Christ's model, Drogo thus became a good shepherd. Indeed, he showed such natural aptitude that, despite his youth, he soon acquired a reputation as a master of his occupation 
					and would tutor others in the lore of shepherdry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cherishing his simple life, Drogo passed much of his time in prayerful contemplation and gave to the poor most of what he received in wages or gifts. His humility, gentleness and 
					generosity quickly earned the villagers' admiration. A constant tradition has it that, while Drogo was out in the fields, tending his flock or deep in prayer, he could sometimes 
					simultaneously be seen attending Mass in the village. This gave rise to a common saying that reportedly persisted to the twentieth century among the rural folk of that region, who, if 
					charged with several onerous tasks, might protest, "I'm not Saint Drogo; I can't ring the church bell for Mass and be in the procession!"
