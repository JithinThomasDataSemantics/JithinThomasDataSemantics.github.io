					Caesarius was a deacon of Africa, martyred at Terracina in Italy. Caesarius denounced the pagan custom of having one youth per year immolate himself to the demons by jumping off a cliff 
					in honour of the god Apollo. The priest of Apollo had him arrested and taken before the governor. He was sentenced to be sewn into a sack and thrown into the sea. He was martyred 
					together with Julian, a local presbyter. While the death of Caesarius has been placed as early as 60 or 110, it is more likely that he actually lived in the 3rd century and died during 
					the reign of Diocletian.

					His feast is held on 1 November. In the 4th century, Emperor Valentinian I was cured at the shrine of Caesarius at Terracina. The emperor then decided to move his relics to Rome. They 
					were taken to a church on the Palatine Hill, and when they were later moved to a new church near the Appian Way which got the name San Cesareo in Palatio.

					Terracina Cathedral is dedicated to him and Saint Peter. The relics of the Saint Caesarius deacon and martyr are preserved in the Basilica Santa 
					Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome (basalt urn of high altar), in the Basilica of San Frediano of Lucca, Tuscany (urn with six bones), and in Terracina Cathedral (urn with two shins and a 
					reliquary arm).
