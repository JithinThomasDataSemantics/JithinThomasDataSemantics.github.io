					May have been of noble or royal birth. Monk. While on a pilgrimage to the Holy Lands, Colman was stopped by the Viennese on suspicion of being a Moravian spy; there was continual 
					fighting between Austria, Moravia and Bohemia, and a stranger who spoke no German was immediately suspect. With no evidence other than being a stranger, he was convicted of espionage, 
					tortured, and hanged with two thieves.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the tradition of the time, the bodies were left to rot as a warning to others. Colman's body hung there for 18 months, incorrupt, and untouched by animals. Miracles were reported at 
					the site, including the scaffolding taking root and putting out branches. In 1015, bishop Megingard transferred Colman's relics to Melk, Austria where they were entombed in an abbey on 
					the Danube. The tomb became a site of miracles, and four popes have granted indulgences to those who call on his intercession. There is an annual blessing of horses and cattle held at 
					Melk and near Fussen, Germany on his feast.
