				Saint Pancras was born in 289 AD in Synnada, Phrygia a kingdom in the west central part of Anatolia (modern Turkey). He is also known by the names Pancritas and Pancratius.  He was 
				orphaned at an early age and taken to Rome by his uncle, Dionysius. Pancras converted to Christianity after meeting Christians in Rome and through the influence of Dionysius.  Pancras 
				lived during the rule of the Roman Emperor Diocletian (r.284-305). Emperor Diocletian mounted some of the fiercest persecutions of the early Church especially in the East of the Empire. 
				Converting to Christianity during this period was highly dangerous and at the age Pancras announced his Christian faith publically.  He was arrested and then beheaded.
