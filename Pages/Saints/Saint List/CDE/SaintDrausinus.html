					Drausinus was the bishop of Soissons, France. He established several foundations, even getting the tyrant Ebroin, who cared nothing for the Church, to help establish a chapel for sick 
					nuns. Mediaeval legend says that to spend the night at Drausinus, tomb made one invincible; whole platoons of soldiers used to camp out at the tomb the night before a battle. His 
					patronage also helps thwart the plans of your enemies. He is the patron saint of Champions,Invincible People and tobe invisible.
				</p>
				<p>
					St Thomas Becket also visited the tomb before he returned to England' where he was murdered at the altar of Canterbury Cathedral, so you can't put all your faith in a saint's legend.
					and his feast day is celebrated on March 7th.
