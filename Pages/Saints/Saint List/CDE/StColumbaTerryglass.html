					Columba of Terryglass (died 12 December 552) was the son of Crinthainn and a disciple of St. Finnian of Clonard. He was one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.
				</p>
				<p>
					When Saint Finnian was in extremis, suffering from the plague, Columba administered Holy Viaticum. Having completed his studies, he took charge of Saints Caemban, Fintan, and Mocumin. 
					He founded the celebrated monastery of Tirdaglas (Tir-da-glas√≠), or Terryglass in 548. It is said that he visited Tours and brought from there the relics of St. Martin of Tours.
				</p>
				<p>
					He died of the plague on 12 December 552, and was buried within the precincts of his own monastery at Terryglass. Some fifteen other saints of Ireland, bearing the name Columba, are 
					mentioned in the Martyrology of Gorman.
