					St. Julian the Hospitaller, or "the Poor Man," came from a wealthy, noble family in the early 4th century and is a popular saint in Western Europe. According to a legend, Julian had 
					just recently been married and was a jealous husband. One day when Julian was hunting, he had a vision that he would murder his mother and father.
				</p>
				<p>
					While he was hunting, his mother and father made an unexpected visit to his castle. His wife gave them one of the best rooms. When Julian returned from his hunt and saw the two figures 
					in bed, he assumed it was his wife with a lover. In a jealous rage, Julian killed his mother and father.
				</p>
				<p>
					Julian was so horrified upon learning the truth that he swore to devote the remainder of his life to good works. He and his wife then undertook a pilgrimage to a distant country where 
					he established a hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					The hospital was near a river that was frequently crossed by people prompted to travel by the Holy Crusades. People frequently drowned crossing this river so Julian took responsibility 
					of ferrying travelers across and tending to the sick.
				</p>
				<p>
					One night, thieves came into their hospital and killed Julian and his wife in the same way Julian had killed his mother and father.
				</p>
				<p>
					"There were great miracles without end in that place and land," recounts the legend. "So many that, as it pleased God, their bodies were brought to Brioude (France)."
				</p>
				<p>
					St. Julian is considered the patron of Boatmen, carnival workers, childless people, circus workers, clowns, ferrymen, fiddlers, fiddle players, hospitallers, hotel-keepers, hunters, innkeepers, jugglers, knights, 
					murderers, pilgrims, shepherds, to obtain lodging while traveling, travelers  also called "the Poor." Reported in the doubtful Golden Legend, Julian slew his noble parents in a case of 
					mistaken identity. He believed his wife was with another man and struck them both. His wife returned home from church soon after. In penance, Julian and his wife went to Rome. Returning 
					after receiving absolution, Julian built an inn and a hospital for the poor. He even put a leper into his own bed. That leper was an angel.
