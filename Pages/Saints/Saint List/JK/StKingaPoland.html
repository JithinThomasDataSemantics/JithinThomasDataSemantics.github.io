					She reluctantly married Bolesław V the Chaste. Kinga later became princess when her husband ascended the throne as Prince of Cracov. Despite the marriage, the devout couple took up a vow 
					of chastity. The marriage was largely arranged by and the vow of chastity patterned after that of Boleslaw's sister Salome of Cracow.

					During her reign Kinga got involved in charitable works such as visiting the poor and helping the lepers. When her husband died in 1279, she sold all her material possessions and gave 
					the money to the poor. She soon did not want any part in governing the kingdom which was left to her and decided to join the Poor Clares monastery at Sandec (Stary Sącz).
					She would spend the rest of her life in contemplative prayer and did not allow anyone to refer to her past role as Grand Duchess of Poland. She died on July 24, 1292.
