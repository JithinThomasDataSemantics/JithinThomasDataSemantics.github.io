					Born in Spain in 1542, John learned the importance of self-sacrificing love from his parents. His father gave up wealth, status, and comfort when he married a weaver's daughter and was 
					disowned by his noble family. After his father died, his mother kept the destitute family together as they wandered homeless in search of work. These were the examples of sacrifice that 
					John followed with his own great love -- God.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the family finally found work, John still went hungry in the middle of the wealthiest city in Spain. At fourteen, John took a job caring for hospital patients who suffered from 
					incurable diseases and madness. It was out of this poverty and suffering, that John learned to search for beauty and happiness not in the world, but in God.
				</p>
				<p>
					After John joined the Carmelite order, Saint Teresa of Avila asked him to help her reform movement. John supported her belief that the order should return to its life of prayer. But 
					many Carmelites felt threatened by this reform, and some members of John's own order kidnapped him. He was locked in a cell six feet by ten feet and beaten three times a week by the 
					monks. There was only one tiny window high up near the ceiling. Yet in that unbearable dark, cold, and desolation, his love and faith were like fire and light. He had nothing left but 
					God -- and God brought John his greatest joys in that tiny cell.
				</p>
				<p>
					After nine months, John escaped by unscrewing the lock on his door and creeping past the guard. Taking only the mystical poetry he had written in his cell, he climbed out a window using 
					a rope made of stirps of blankets. With no idea where he was, he followed a dog to civilization. He hid from pursuers in a convent infirmary where he read his poetry to the nuns. From 
					then on his life was devoted to sharing and explaining his experience of God's love.
				</p>
				<p>
					His life of poverty and persecution could have produced a bitter cynic. Instead it gave birth to a compassionate mystic, who lived by the beliefs that "Who has ever seen people 
					persuaded to love God by harshness?" and "Where there is no love, put love -- and you will find love."
				</p>
				<p>
					John left us many books of practical advice on spiritual growth and prayer that are just as relevant today as they were then. These books include:
				</p>
				<p>

					Ascent of Mount Carmel
				</p>
				<p>
					Dark Night of the Soul
				</p>
				<p>
					and A Spiritual Canticle of the Soul and the Bridegroom Christ
				</p>
				<p>
					Since joy comes only from God, John believed that someone who seeks happiness in the world is like "a famished person who opens his mouth to satisfy himself with air." He taught that 
					only by breaking the rope of our desires could we fly up to God. Above all, he was concerned for those who suffered dryness or depression in their spiritual life and offered 
					encouragement that God loved them and was leading them deeper into faith.
					
					He is the patron of contemplatives and contemplative life along with St. Mary Magdalene
				</p>
				<p>
					"What more do you want, o soul! And what else do you search for outside, when within yourself you possess your riches, delights, satisfaction and kingdom -- your beloved whom you desire 
					and seek? Desire him there, adore him there. Do not go in pursuit of him outside yourself. You will only become distracted and you won't find him, or enjoy him more than by seeking him 
					within you." -- Saint John of the Cross
