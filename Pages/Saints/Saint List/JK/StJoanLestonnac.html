					Saint Joan de Lestonnac was born in Bordeaux, France, in 1556. She was happily married with four children, until her husband tragically passed away. After his passing, Joan 
					singlehandedly ran her home and estate. When her children were grown and established, she entered religious life. She eventually established her own religious community, and she and her 
					sisters ministered to plague victims, assisted the poor, and combated the heresy of Calvinism. However, one of her fellow nuns decided to conspire against her, resulting in her election 
					as superior and Joan's removal. The new superior maliciously mistreated Joan, but Joan stood strong and did not retaliate with anger. Eventually, the cruel nun repented, but Joan no 
					longer wanted to be reinstated as superior. She acted as a retired member of her order for the rest of her life. Saint Joan de Lestonnac was canonized in 1949, and is the patron saint 
					of abuse victims, people rejected by religious orders, and widows
