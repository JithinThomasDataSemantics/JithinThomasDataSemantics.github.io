					Raised in a pious and hardworking family near the Pyrenees mountains. Entered the seminary at age 12, but when his hearing began to fail in his teens, he was sent home. Joined the 
					Brothers of the Christian Schools at age 19, entering the noviate on 24 February1917 at Irun, Spain, taking the name Jaime Hilario. Exceptional teacher and catechist, he believed 
					strongly in the value of universal education, especially for the poor. However, his hearing problems grew worse, and in the early 1930s, he was forced to retire fromteaching, and began 
					work in the garden at the LaSalle house at San Jose, Tarragona, Spain.

					prison ship with some other religious. Convicted on 15 January 1937 of being a Christian brother. Two rounds of volley fire from a firing squad did not kill him, possibly because some 
					of soldiersintentionally shot wide; their commander then murdered Jaime with five shots at close range. First of the 97 LaSalle Brothers killed in Catalunia, Spain during the Spanish 
					Civil War to be recognized as a martyr.
