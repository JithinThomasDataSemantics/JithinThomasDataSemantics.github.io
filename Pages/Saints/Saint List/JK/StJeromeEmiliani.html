					St. Jerome was born in Venice of a noble family. After entering the military he was imprisoned for three years. It is believed that he was released from prison by the Blessed Mother. He 
					then dedicated himself to life of service. St. Jerome founded the Company of the Poor, clerks regular, which was approved by Pope Paul the III in 1540. He is the <b>Patron Saint of 
					Abandoned Infants and Orphans</b>.

					St. Jerome was a careless and irreligious soldier for the city-state of Venice, Jerome was captured in a skirmish at an outpost town and chained in a dungeon. In prison Jerome had a lot of time to 
					think, and he gradually learned how to pray. When he escaped, he returned to Venice where he took charge of the education of his nephewsâ€”and began his own studies for the priesthood.

					In the years after his ordination, events again called Jerome to a decision and a new lifestyle. Plague and famine swept northern Italy. Jerome began caring for the sick and feeding the 
					hungry at his own expense. While serving the sick and the poor, he soon resolved to devote himself and his property solely to others, particularly to abandoned children. He founded 
					three orphanages, a shelter for penitent prostitutes and a hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					Around 1532, Jerome and two other priests established a congregation, the Clerks Regular of Somasca, dedicated to the care of orphans and the education of youth. Jerome died in 1537 
					from a disease he caught while tending the sick. He was canonized in 1767. In 1928, Pius Xl named him the patron of orphans and abandoned children.
