					Jane Frances de Chantal was wife, mother, nun, and founder of a religious community. Her mother died when she was 18 months old, and her father, head of parliament at Dijon, France, became the 
					main influence on her education. Jane developed into a woman of beauty and refinement, lively and cheerful in temperament. At 21, she married Baron de Chantal, by whom she had six 
					children, three of whom died in infancy. At her castle, she restored the custom of daily Mass, and was seriously engaged in various charitable works.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jane's husband was killed after seven years of marriage, and she sank into deep dejection for four months at her family home. Her father-in-law threatened to disinherit her children if 
					she did not return to his home. He was then 75, vain, fierce, and extravagant. Jane Frances managed to remain cheerful in spite of him and his insolent housekeeper.
				</p>
				<p>
					When she was 32, she met Saint Francis de Sales who became her spiritual director, softening some of the severities imposed by her former director. She wanted to become a nun but he 
					persuaded her to defer this decision. She took a vow to remain unmarried and to obey her director.
				</p>
				<p>
					After three years, Francis told her of his plan to found an institute of women which would be a haven for those whose health, age, or other considerations barred them from entering the 
					already established communities. There would be no cloister, and they would be free to undertake spiritual and corporal works of mercy. They were primarily intended to exemplify the 
					virtues of Mary at the Visitation (hence their name, the Visitation nuns): humility and meekness.
				</p>
				<p>
					The usual opposition to women in active ministry arose and Francis de Sales was obliged to make it a cloistered community following the Rule of Saint Augustine. Francis wrote his famous 
					Treatise on the Love of God for them. The congregation (three women) began when Jane Frances was 45. She underwent great sufferings: Francis de Sales died; her son was killed; a plague 
					ravaged France; her daughter-in-law and son-in-law died. She encouraged the local authorities to make great efforts for the victims of the plague and she put all her convent's resources 
					at the disposal of the sick.
				</p>
				<p>
					During a part of her religious life, she had to undergo great trials of the spirit-interior anguish, darkness, and spiritual dryness. She died while on a visitation of convents of the 
					community.
