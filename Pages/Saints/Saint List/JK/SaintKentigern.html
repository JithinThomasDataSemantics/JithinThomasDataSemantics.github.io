					Kentigern was born near Edinburgh, Scotland in the sixth century. His mother, St Enoch, was daughter of the King of Lothian. Her pregnancy was illegitimate, the result of rape by one of 
					her suitors, whose identity she refused to reveal. Her father was so incensed, he had Enoch and her child cast adrift in an open boat on the Firth of Forth, expecting them to perish. 
					The currents carried them across to the other side of the Firth, bringing them to land near the present town of Culross where they were offered shelter at the monastery of St Serf.
				</p>
				<p>
					Serf took the boy under his special care, educating him and training him in the monastic life. When he reached manhood Kentigern left the monastery and journeyed across to the west of 
					Scotland, finally establishing his own religious foundation on the site of the cathedral in Glasgow. Here he set about converting the area to Christianity. At a later stage he journeyed 
					south into England and many parishes along his route still bear his name. Legend has it that he finally reached North Wales and spent several years there before returning again to 
					Scotland, where he died c. 603.
				</p>
				<p>
					From the time of his death Saint Kentigern was venerated as Glasgow's patron saint, and the cathedral of Glasgow was built in his honour. To this day his figure and the symbols 
					associated with his legend make up the crest of the City of Glasgow.
