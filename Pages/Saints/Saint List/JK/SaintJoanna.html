					We know Saint Joanna only through Luke's Gospel. In Chapter 8, we learn that she was the wife of a man named Chuza, who was a steward to Herod. In this brief account she, along with Mary 
					Magdalene, a woman Susanna, and "many others", is described as providing for Jesus out of personal resources as he traveled, preaching and healing in many villages and cities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other time Joanna is referenced is of course the account of Easter morning in Chapter 24. She was one of the women who arrived at the tomb with spices to prepare His body for 
					burial, but found the stone moved and the body gone. They were confronted with two men in dazzling clothes who told them that He had Risen, and reminded them of Jesus' own words that He 
					would be crucified and rise again. The women left the tomb and told the apostles what they had seen and heard.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though we know so little about her, it would seem she was a generous and devoted woman. She served our Lord in His ministry as well as after His death. In both descriptions she used her 
					own means to provide for Him, and in return she had the honour of being one of the first people to truly understand His Resurrection.
