					Saint Anastasia Patricia was the beautiful daughter of an Egyptian nobleman and a lady-in-waiting at the court of Emperor Justinian in Constantinople. To escape the attentions of the 
					Emperor, she left the court and entered a convent in Alexandria. On the death of Justinian's wife, Theodora, the Emperor again sought her, whereupon she fled to the desert and met Abbot 
					Daniel, who allowed her to dress as a monk and live as a hermit in his community, at a time when this was only permitted of men. She lived a solitary life of constant prayer and 
					austerity until her death twenty-eight years later.

					When Anastasia was nearing death, Daniel visited her with his disciple to give her communion and hear her last words. Daniel revealed the full details of her story to his disciple after 
					her death.
