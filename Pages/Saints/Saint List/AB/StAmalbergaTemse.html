					Amalberga of Temse (born about 741, died 10 July 772) was a Lotharingian noblewoman from the Frankish royal house of the Pippinids who is celebrated as a saint in the Roman Catholic 
					Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. She is especially venerated in Temse, Ghent, Munsterbilzen and other parts of Flanders. She received the veil from Saint Willibrord of 
					Echternach.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many miracles, such as crossing the river Scheldt on a giant fish are attributed to her. In heraldry and art this is a sturgeon. Her relics are kept inside the church of Temse.
				</p>
				<p>
					Her vita is connected to Charlemagne, whom her biographer (Goscelin of St. Bertin) said wanted to marry her. When she refused in order to continue her vocation as a virgin, he tried to 
					move her by force; he broke her arm, but was unable to carry her off. He fell ill because of his actions, but she forgave him and prayed to God to heal him.
				</p>
				<p>
					The virgin Amalberga of Temse should not be confused with Amalberga of Maubeuge.
