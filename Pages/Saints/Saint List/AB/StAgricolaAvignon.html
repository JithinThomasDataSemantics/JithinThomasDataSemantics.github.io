					Saint Agricola (Agricol, Agricolus) of Avignon (c. 630-c. 700) was a bishop of Avignon. Agricola was the son of Saint Magnus, a senator who became a monk and then a bishop as a widower.
				</p>
				<p>
					Agricola went to Lerins, his father's episcopal see, when he was fourteen and at the age of sixteen, he was professed a monk. However, at the age of thirty, he was summoned by his 
					father Magnus to Avignon, where he was appointed coadjutor. When his father died in 660, he succeeded him as bishop. He built a church in the city that was staffed by the monks of 
					Lerins. He built a convent for Benedictine nuns. He was a well-known preacher, and famous for his charity and defense of the poor and sick against civil authorities. He died of natural 
					causes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fifteenth-century documents record that he prevented an invasion of storks by his blessing. He is thus patron of storks and is depicted with them as his emblem.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1647, St. Agricola was named the patron saint of Avignon. He is also invoked against gambling and misfortune of all kinds. Devotees prayed to him fine harvests, and 
					rain. He is also the patron for good weather along with St Clare of Assisi and St Medard of Noyon
