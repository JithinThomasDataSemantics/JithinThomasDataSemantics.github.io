					Saint Ansovinus was a Priest and  Hermit at Castel Raimondo near Torcello, Italy. He was the bishop of Camerino, Italy, consecrated by Pope Leo IV; he accepted the vocation on the condition 
					that his parishioners did not have to recruit soldiers, an obligation imposed on most bishops of the time. Confessor to Emperor Louis the Pious. Attended the Council of Rome called by 
					Pope Saint Nicholas I in 861. Miracle worker. His association with crops come from his work of feeding the poor. Once when the granary was empty, but there were still poor people to feed,
					he prayed for help; the granary was found to be full, and everyone ate their fill.
