					In the mid-third century the Christians of Comana, in Pontus, sent representatives to St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, Bishop of Neocaesarea, requesting a Bishop for their city. So St. Gregory 
					went to Comana to look for a shepherd for the new Diocese. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A city commission had sought out candidates of noble birth, great eloquence, or other such qualities. When all these were presented to him, St. Gregory advised the commission that they 
					should consider virtue first, and not despise those of more humble appearance. One of these officials, deriding the counsel of St. Gregory, replied: ‘If you don’t want one from among 
					our most distinguished citizens, perhaps we should choose a Bishop from among the plebeians. In this case, I counsel you to bring forth Alexander the charcoal-burner so that we can all 
					acquiesce in the matter.’ 
				</p>
				<p>
					St. Gregory asked: "Who is this Alexander?" Laughing, they brought Alexander to him. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of the charcoal dust, his face, hands, and modest clothing were black with dirt. The assembly laughed at seeing such a figure among the candidates for Bishop. Alexander remained 
					self-composed, unembarrassed at his modest condition. In fact, contrary to appearances, he was a gifted philosopher, a truly wise man. It was not need that caused him to take up that 
					profession, but his will to practice a life of virtue removed from public admiration. Young and handsome, he desired to live chastely avoiding occasions of sin. The charcoal dust 
					disguised his face and, like a mask, prevented his features from being noticed. The work provided just enough for him to live and practice small works of charity. 
				</p>
				<p>
					St. Gregory ordered Alexander to take a bath and put on his own episcopal robes. In a short time, a completely different man appeared, attracting the attention of all who were assembled 
					there. St. Gregory told them: "Do not be surprised if you were fooled in your judgment, which you only made according to what you could see. The Devil wanted to hide this vessel of 
					election and keep him from being a Bishop." 
				</p>
				<p>
					He consecrated Alexander as Bishop. In his first sermon, Alexander astonished the whole assembly with the wisdom and eloquence of his words. An Athenian who was present criticized him 
					for lacking Greek elegance, but was reprehended by an apparition. 
				</p>
				<p>
					St. Alexander became famous for his preaching and governed the church of Comana in a dignified way until the persecution under Emperor Decius, when he was burned to death, dying a 
					martyr for the Catholic Faith.
