					Saint Agapitus was born of Christian parents in Cappadocia during the reign of the emperors Diocletian (284-305) and Maximian (284-305). From his youth he yearned for the monastic life 
					and so he entered a monastery, where he struggled in fasting, prayer, and service to all the brethren of the monastery.

				<p>
					The Lord granted Saint Agapitus the gift of wonderworking. The emperor, Licinius (311-324), learned that Saint Agapitus was endowed with great physical strength, and he commanded the 
					saint to be conscripted into military service against his wishes.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the persecution against the Christians initiated by Licinius, Saint Agapitus was was wounded by a spear, but remained alive. After the death of the emperor Licinius, he obtained 
					his freedom from military service in the following manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					The holy Emperor Constantine the Great (306-337) heard that Saint Agapitus had healed people by his prayers. The emperor sent him a sick servant, who also received healing. The emperor 
					wanted to reward Saint Agapitus, who instead asked only that he be permitted to resign from military service and return to his monastery. Permission was granted, and he joyfully 
					returned to the monastery.
				</p>
				<p>
					Soon after this, the Bishop of Sinaus in Bithynia summoned Saint Agapitus and ordained him to the holy priesthood. After the death of the bishop, Saint Agapitus was unanimously chosen 
					by the clergy and all the people to the See of Sinaus. The new hierarch wisely governed his flock, guiding it in the Orthodox faith and virtuous life. Through his prayers, numerous 
					miracles occurred. The saint died in peace.
