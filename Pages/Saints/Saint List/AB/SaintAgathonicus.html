					Saint Agathonicus was a 3rd-century citizen of Nicomedia. While living in Greece, he taught the Greeks about Christianity. Meanwhile, the imperial governor began persecuting 
					Christians, following the orders of Emperor Maximian. In this persecution, Agathonicus' companion Zoticus was seized in Carpe, and his followers were crucified. He was sent to 
					Nicomedia, where Agathonicus and his companions Princeps, Theoprepius, Acyndinus, Severian, Zeno, along with many others, were then taken to Byzantium. On this journey, many of the 
					companions died from exhaustion and abuse, and the others were killed in Chalcedon. The survivors were taken to Thrace in Selymbria, where, after being tortured in front of the Greek 
					Emperor, were beheaded.
