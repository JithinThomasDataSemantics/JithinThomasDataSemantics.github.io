					Saint Agabus (also known as Saint Agabo, died 1st Century), one of the seventy disciples of Christ sent out to preach the Gospel, and holy martyr of Antioch. Saint Agabus was graced 
					with the gift of prophecy, and was likely present in the upper room on the day of Pentecost. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint Agabus is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, in which he is recorded as predicting a great famine thorughout the Roman Empire.(Ref:Acts 11: 27-28)
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint Agabus later predicted the imprisonment of Paul, attempting unsuccessfully to convince him to refrain from journeying to Jerusalem.(Ref: Acts 21: 10-15)
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint Agabus traveled, preaching the Gospel with his fellow disciples of Christ. He converted both Jews and Greeks, attracting the attention of the Jews of Jerusalem. He was arrested, 
					tortured, beaten, and dragged by a rope around his neck outside the city. He was stoned to death at Antioch. At the moment of his death, a glowing light from Heaven shone down, causing 
					those in attendance to look upon it in amazement. A Jewish woman proclaimed, "Truly this man was righteous,‚Äù and converted to Christianity on the spot. The crowds promptly stoned her 
					and she was buried with the holy saint in his tomb.
