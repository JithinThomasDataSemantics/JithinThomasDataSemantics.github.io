					Martyr and preacher, companion of St. Ursus, also called Albinus in some lists. He is traditionally known as a Greek or Albanian priest who went with St. Ursus to the city of Milan in 
					Italy. They had left the island of Naxos in Greece to escape the Arians in control of the Church in that area. St. Ambrose welcomed Alban and Ursus, sending them into France and Germany 
					to convert the pagan tribes there. Ursus was killed on the way, but Alban settled in Mainz. There he became famous as a preacher, attacking the false doctrines of the Arians. He is 
					believed to have been slain by the Vandals, who attacked the region. Alban was beheaded at Hanum after being slain.
