					Some saints show marks of holiness very early. Not Angela! Born of a leading family in Foligno, Italy, she became immersed in the quest for wealth and social position. As a wife and 
					mother, she continued this life of distraction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Around the age of 40, she recognized the emptiness of her life and sought God's help in the Sacrament of Penance. Her Franciscan confessor helped Angela to seek God's pardon for her 
					previous life and to dedicate herself to prayer and the works of charity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shortly after her conversion, her husband and children died. Selling most of her possessions, she entered the Secular Franciscan Order. She was alternately absorbed by meditating on the 
					crucified Christ and by serving the poor of Foligno as a nurse and beggar for their needs. Other women joined her in a religious community.
				</p>
				<p>
					At her confessor's advice, Angela wrote her Book of Visions and Instructions. In it she recalls some of the temptations she suffered after her conversion; she also expresses her thanks 
					to God for the Incarnation of Jesus. This book and her life earned for Angela the title "Teacher of Theologians." She was beatified in 1693, and canonized in 2013.
				</p>
				<p>
					She is thr patroness on Sexual Temptation along with St Catherine of Siena, St Margaret of Cortona, St Mary of Edessa, St Mary of Egypt, St Mary Magdalene, St Mary Magdalen of Pazzi, 
					and St Pelagia of Antioch.
