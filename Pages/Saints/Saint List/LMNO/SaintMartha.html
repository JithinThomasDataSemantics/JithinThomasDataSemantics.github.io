					Martha, Mary, and their brother Lazarus were evidently close friends of Jesus. He came to their home simply as a welcomed guest, rather than as one celebrating the conversion of a 
					sinner like Zacchaeus or one unceremoniously received by a suspicious Pharisee. The sisters feel free to call on Jesus at their brother's death, even though a return to Judea at that 
					time seems almost certain death.

					No doubt Martha was an active sort of person. On one occasion, she prepares the meal for Jesus and possibly his fellow guests and forthrightly states the obvious: All hands should pitch 
					in to help with the dinner.

					Yet, as biblical scholar Father John McKenzie points out, she need not be rated as an "unrecollected activist." The evangelist is emphasizing what our Lord said on several occasions 
					about the primacy of the spiritual: " Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear.. But seek first the kingdom of God and his 
					righteousness" (Matthew 6:25b, 33a); "One does not live by bread alone" (Luke 4:4b); "Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness.." (Matthew 5:6a).
				</p>
				<p>
					Martha's great glory is her simple and strong statement of faith in Jesus after her brother's death. "Jesus told her, "I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me, even 
					if he dies, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?' She said to him, "Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, the 
					Son of God, the one who is coming into the world'" (John 11:25-27).
