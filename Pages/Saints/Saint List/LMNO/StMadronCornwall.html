				Saint Madron of Cornwall was a Monk and hermit. Cures worked at Saint Madron's Church, Cornwall, England. Honoured in Brittany. Like many holy people of the time, there is a well that 
				is considered "his", and is noted for its healing powers. Tradition says that you ask for healing from some ill, then leave a piece of cloth from your clothing at the well; as the cloth 
				deteriorates, the illness dissipates.  He is the patron for Pain Relief and protection against pain. His feast day is celebrated on May 17.
