					Nicholas was born on March 21, 1417 and died on the same day 70 years later in 1487. He was from the canton of Unterwalden in Switzerland. His parents were simple peasants who tried to 
					provide Nicholas with a better education, given his uncommon intelligence and piety. He had an inclination for the contemplative life and practiced severe mortifications. He married and 
					had ten children, some of whom came to hold high positions in the country. He used to wake every night to pray and read a psalter in honor of Our Lady.
				</p>
				<p>
					At age 23 he was called to take arms in a campaign against the canton of Zurich, which rebelled against the Swiss Confederation. Fourteen years later he was still engaged in military 
					service and had achieved the post of captain, having 100 men under his command. In battles Nicolas always fought with the sword in one hand and the rosary in the other. His courage 
					earned him the highest military decorations. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Returning home, he was asked to be mayor of his city, but declined the honor, alleging his humble origin made him unsuitable for that post. However, he accepted the position of judge in 
					the local court, a position that he carried out with rare ability for nine years. Then he retired from this position to his farm to have more time to dedicate himself to matters of the 
					soul. 
				</p>
				<p>
					He had received symbolic visions since childhood. After his retirement, he was watching his flock when he mystically saw a marvelous lily growing from his mouth and rising up to the 
					clouds; suddenly it fell to the ground and was eaten by a horse. He understood that his contemplation of heavenly things was often disturbed and consumed by earthly concerns. He 
					realized he should abandon the world and devote himself exclusively to matters of soul as a hermit. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Although she had just borne his tenth child, his wife heroically consented. He settled at Ranft, a few miles from his home. From the outset of his life as a hermit, he was miraculously 
					nourished only by the Holy Eucharist, which he received once a month.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was loved and venerated by the people, and pilgrims came from distant parts to consult him. He was often called on by dignitaries to make peace between the cantons in their 
					continuous disputes. He always achieved success in those missions. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Shortly before his death he was assailed by strong pains. "O, how terrible is death!" he used to say. But he delivered his last breath in peace. His body was preserved in the Church of 
					Sachseln, a village close to his birthplace. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Even today the visitor can venerate there the bones of Brother Klaus (Nicholas in German), his mortal remains richly ornamented with gold and precious stones, and around his neck 
					countless military decorations of honor.
