					Magnus was Benedictine Priest and  was the Spiritual student of Saint Columban and Saint Gall at Arbon (part of modern Switzerland). He became the superior of his house following the death of Saint Gall. 
					At the request of the bishop of Augsberg, Bavaria, he evangelized in Eptaticus in the eastern part of Allgau, Bavaria. By the River Lech in Bavaria, in a place still known as Sant Mangstritt (footstep of 
					Saint Magnus) he founded the monastery of Fussen.

					Some extraordinary stories grew up around Magnus, often involving animals. In Kempten he dispersed a plague of snakes. At Fussen, he was forced to expel a dragon from the land he needed 
					for the monastery; in one version of the story, he spared an infant dragon who helped local farmers by hunting rats, mice and other crop-damaging vermin. While on a walk in the woods 
					near the monastery, he encountered a bear who showed him a vein of iron ore; he gave the bear some cake. The bear followed Magnus back to the abbey where the saint rounded up some tools 
					and monks; the bear then led them all to several other iron ore sources in the nearby mountains, thus helping found the area's most lucrative industry.
