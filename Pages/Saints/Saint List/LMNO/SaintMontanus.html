				Saint Montanus was martyred along with Flavian, Julian, Lucius, Victoricus, and five other companions under the persecution of Valerian. Montanus and his fellows were disciples of Saint 
				Cypiran of Carthage. The 10 companions did not waver in or deny their Christian faith when revolt broke out in Carthage and was blamed on the Christians. These holy men were tortured 
				and beheaded in 259.

				His feast is celebrated on February 24.
