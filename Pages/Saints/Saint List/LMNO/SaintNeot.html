					St. Neot, a Glastonbury, England monk who died in 877, is the patron saint of fish. He was also reportedly only 15 inches tall and spent his days in a well, water up to his neck, 
					practicing his devotions.

					To this holy hermit is generally ascribed the glorious project of the foundation of our first and most noble university, in which he was King Alfred’s first adviser. 1 St. Neot was born 
					of noble parentage, and, according to many authors, related to King Alfred. In his youth he took the monastic habit at Glastenbury, and pursued his studies with great application, in 
					which a natural strong inclination from his infancy was the index of his extraordinary genius and capacity. He became one of the greatest scholars of the age, but was yet more admirable 
					for his humility, piety, and devotion. The bishop of the diocess was so taken with his saintly deportment and conversation, that when the saint was yet very young, he, by compulsion, 
					ordained him first deacon, and soon after priest. St. Neot dreaded the danger of being drawn out of his beloved obscurity, which he coveted above all earthly blessings: being more 
					desirous to slide gently through the world without being so much as taken notice of by others, and without being distracted from applying his mind to his only great affair in this life, 
					than most men are to bustle and make parade on the theatre of the world. He feared particularly the insinuating poison of vanity, which easily steals into the heart amidst applause, 
					even without being perceived. Therefore, with the leave of his superior, he retired to his solitude in Cornwall, which was then called St. Guerir’s, from a British saint of that name, 
					but is since called, from our holy anchoret, Neot-stoke. In this hermitage he emaciated his body by rigorous fasts, and nourished his soul with heavenly contemplation, in which he 
					received great favours of God, and was sometimes honoured with the visits of angels. After seven years spent in this retreat, he made a pilgrimage to Rome; but returned again to the 
					same cell. Several persons of quality and virtue began to resort to him to beg the assistance of his prayers and holy counsels; and the reputation of his wisdom and experience in the 
					paths of an interior life reached the ears of King Alfred. 2 That great prince, from that time, especially while he lay concealed in Somersetshire, to the death of the holy hermit, 
					frequently visited him, and doubtless, by his discourses, received great light, and was inflamed with fresh ardour in the practice of virtue. St. Neot’s counsels were also to him of 
					great use for regulating the government of his kingdom. Our saint particularly recommended to him the advancement of useful and sacred studies, and advised him to repair the schools of 
					the English founded at Rome, and to establish others at home. Both which things this king most munificently executed.
