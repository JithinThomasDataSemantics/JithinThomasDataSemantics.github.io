					The first act of the apostles after the Ascension of Jesus was to find a replacement for Judas. With all the questions, doubts, and dangers facing them, they chose to focus their 
					attention on finding a twelfth apostle. Why was this important? Twelve was a very important number to the Chosen People: twelve was the number of the twelve tribes of Israel. If the new 
					Israel was to come from the disciples of Jesus, a twelfth apostle was needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					But Jesus had chosen the original twelve. How could they know whom he would choose?
				</p>
				<p>
					One hundred and twenty people were gathered for prayer and reflection in the upper room, when Peter stood up to propose the way to make the choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Peter had one criterion, that, like Andrew, James, John, and himself, the new apostle be someone who had been a disciple from the very beginning, from his baptism by John until the 
					Ascension. The reason for this was simple, the new apostle would must become a witness to Jesus' resurrection. He must have followed Jesus before anyone knew him, stayed with him when 
					he made enemies, and believed in him when he spoke of the cross and of eating his body -- teachings that had made others melt away.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two men fit this description -- Matthias and Joseph called Barsabbas. They knew that both these men had been with them and with Jesus through his whole ministry. But which one had the 
					heart to become a witness to his resurrection. The apostles knew that only the Lord could know what was in the heart of each. They cast lots in order to discover God's will and Matthias 
					was chosen. He was the twelfth apostle and the group was whole again as they waited for the coming of the Holy Spirit.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's the first we hear of Matthias in Scripture, and the last. Legends like the Acts of Andrew and Matthias testify to Matthias' enthusiastic embrace of all that being an apostle 
					meant including evangelization, persecution, and death in the service of the Lord.
				</p>
				<p>
					How does one qualify to be an apostle?
				</p>
				<p>
					Clement of Alexandria says that Matthias, like all the other apostles, was not chosen by Jesus for what he already was, but for what Jesus foresaw he would become. He was elected not 
					because he was worthy but because he would become worthy. Jesus chooses all of us in the same way. What does Jesus want you to become?
