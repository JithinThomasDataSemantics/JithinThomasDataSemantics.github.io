					The veneration of St. Matthew goes back to the fifth century. The New Testament describes Matthew as a Levi and a tax collector. He was born in Capernanum (Mt 9:9) and is the author of 
					the First Gospel, which was written in Aramic. St. Matthew probably evangelized Persia and Ethiopia. He was Martyred in Ethiopia. St. Matthew is the <b>Patron Saint of Accountants, 
					Bankers, Bookkeepers, Custom Officials, and Tax Collectors.</b>
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Little is known about St. Matthew, except that he was the son of Alpheus, and he was likely born in Galilee. He worked as a tax collector, which was a hated profession during the time 
					of Christ.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the Gospel, Matthew was working at a collection booth in Capernaum when Christ came to him and asked, "Follow me." With this simple call, Matthew became a disciple of Christ.
				</p>
				<p>
					From Matthew we know of the many doings of Christ and the message Christ spread of salvation for all people who come to God through Him. The Gospel account of Matthew tells the same 
					story as that found in the other three Gospels, so scholars are certain of its authenticity. His book is the first of the four Gospels in the New Testament.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many years following the death of Christ, around 41 and 50 AD, Matthew wrote his gospel account. He wrote the book in Aramaic in the hope that his account would convince his fellow 
					people that Jesus was the Messiah and that His kingdom had been fulfilled in a spiritual way. It was an important message at a time when almost everyone was expecting the return of a 
					militant messiah brandishing a sword.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is thought he departed for other lands to escape persecution sometime after 42 AD. According to various legends he fled to Parthia and Persia, or Ethiopia. Nothing is recorded of 
					Matthew's passing. We do not know how he died, if his death was natural or if he was martyred.
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint Matthew is often depicted with one of the four living creatures of Revelation 4:7, which reads, "The first living creature was like a lion, the second like a bull, the third 
					living creature had a human face, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle."
				</p>
				<p>
					Matthew was a tax collector and is therefore the patron saint of bankers. The Church established St. Matthew's feast day as September 21.
