					Most of what we know about Mark comes directly from the New Testament. He is usually identified with the Mark of Acts 12:12. When St. Peter escaped from prison, he went to the home of 
					Mark's mother.

					Paul and Barnabas took him along on the first missionary journey, but for some reason Mark returned alone to Jerusalem. It is evident, from Paul's refusal to let Mark accompany him on 
					the second journey despite Barnabas's insistence, that Mark had displeased Paul. Because Paul later asks Mark to visit him in prison, we may assume the trouble did not last long.

					The oldest and the shortest of the four Gospels, the Gospel of Mark emphasizes Jesus's rejection by humanity while being God's triumphant envoy. Probably written for gentile converts in 
					Rome-after the death of Peter and Paul sometime between A.D. 60 and 70-Mark's Gospel is the gradual manifestation of a "scandal": a crucified Messiah.
				</p>

					Evidently a friend of Mark–calling him "my son"–Peter is only one of this Gospel‘s sources, others being the Church in Jerusalem (Jewish roots), and the Church at Antioch (largely 
					gentile).

					Like another Gospel writer Luke, Mark was not one of the 12 apostles. We cannot be certain whether he knew Jesus personally. Some scholars feel that the evangelist is speaking of 
					himself when describing the arrest of Jesus in Gethsemane: "Now a young man followed him wearing nothing but a linen cloth about his body. They seized him, but he left the cloth behind 
					and ran off naked" (Mark 14:51-52).
				</p>
				<p>
					Others hold Mark to be the first bishop of Alexandria, Egypt. Venice, famous for the Piazza San Marco, claims Mark as its patron saint; the large basilica there is believed to contain 
					his remains.
				</p>
				<p>
					A winged lion is Mark's symbol. The lion derives from Mark's description of John the Baptist as a "voice of one crying out in the desert" (Mark 1:3), which artists compared to a roaring 
					lion. The wings come from the application of Ezekiel's vision of four winged creatures to the evangelists.
