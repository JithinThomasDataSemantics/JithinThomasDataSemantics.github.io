					In 931, Pope John XI asked Odo to reform all the monasteries in the Aquitaine, northern France and Italy. Negotiated a peace between Heberic of Rome and Hugh of Provence in 936; 
					returned twice in six years to renegotiate the peace between them. Persuaded many secular leaders to give up control of monasteries so they could return to being spiritual centers, not 
					sources of cash for the state. Founded the monastery of Our Lady on the Aventine in Rome. Wrote a biography of Saint Gerald of Aurillac, three books of essays on morality, some 
					homilies, an epic poem on the Redemption, and twelve choral antiphons in honour of Saint Martin of Tours. Noted for his knowledge, his administrative abilities, his skills as a 
					reformer, and as a writer; also known for his charity, he has been depicted giving the poor the clothes off his back.

					He is the patron for Rain along with St. Agricola of Avignon, St. Eulalia, St. Heribert of Cologne, St. Isidore the Farmer, St. Julian of Cuenca and St. Theodore of Sykeon.
					His feast is celebrated on November 18.
