					Saint Michael Argemir also known as Saint Michael of the Saints  is a Trinitarian venerated at the church of St Paul's Shipwreck, Valletta.
				</p>
				<p>
					Michael Argemir was born in Spain on 29 September 1591. He became a Trinitarian friar in 1607 and took the name of Michael of the Saints. His brief life of 33 years was one great love 
					for our Lord in the blessed Sacrament.
				</p>
				<p>
					His generous service to the poor, the unfortunate and the sick made him a compassionate priest and faithful friend. His ministry did not end with his death. After 11 days of prayer, 
					Frances Sanz was cured through his intercession. The cancerous tumours on her lip and tongue disappeared. No scars were left.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hers was one of many such cures and was presented as one of the miracles when Pope Pius IX canonised Michael on 8 June 1862. Each one of us finds himself tormented by one thing or 
					another, especially where illness is concerned.
