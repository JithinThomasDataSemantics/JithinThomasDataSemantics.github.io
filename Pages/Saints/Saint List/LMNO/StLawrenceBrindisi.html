					St. Lawrence was born in Brindisi, Italy in 1559. He was a pioneer of the Capuchin Order in Germany. St. Lawrence writings both against the Moslems and the Protestant Reformation are 
					classics. He died in Lisbon, Portugal in 1619. Pope John XXIII elevated him to doctor of the Church on March 19, 1959.</em>

					Saint Lawrence was one of seven deacons who were in charge of giving help to the poor and the needy. When a persecution broke out, Pope St. Sixtus was condemned to death. As he was led 
					to execution, Lawrence followed him weeping, "Father, where are you going without your deacon?" he said. "I am not leaving you, my son," answered the Pope. "in three days you will 
					follow me." Full of joy, Lawrence gave to the poor the rest of the money he had on hand and even sold expensive vessels to have more to give away.

					The Prefect of Rome, a greedy pagan, thought the Church had a great fortune hidden away. So he ordered Lawrence to bring the Church's treasure to him. The Saint said he would, in three 
					days. Then he went through the city and gathered together all the poor and sick people supported by the Church. When he showed them to the Prefect, he said: "This is the Church's 
					treasure!"
				</p>
				<p>
					In great anger, the Prefect condemned Lawrence to a slow, cruel death. The Saint was tied on top of an iron grill over a slow fire that roasted his flesh little by little, but Lawrence 
					was burning with so much love of God that he almost did not feel the flames. In fact, God gave him so much strength and joy that he even joked. "Turn me over," he said to the judge. 
					"I'm done on this side!" And just before he died, he said, "It's cooked enough now." Then he prayed that the city of Rome might be converted to Jesus and that the Catholic Faith might 
					spread all over the world. After that, he went to receive the martyr's reward. Saint Lawrence's feast day is August 10th.
