					Rene Goupil, the Patron Saint of Anaesthetists, and a Patron Saint of Canada, was born in Angers, France in 1608 and studied surgery. He joined the Jesuits as a donne or volunteer 
					worker in 1640 and served in the then tiny colony of Quebec as one of the first medical workers of Canada. After earning meritorious praise for his skills, he again volunteered to 
					attend the Hurons at Sainte Marie, a mission far beyond the frontiers. Rene's canoe party was ambushed. He was captured by the Mohawks and endured eight weeks of cruel torture before 
					being killed on September 29, 1642. Rene was the first of eight North American martyrs whose dedication was recognized by canonization in 1930. St. Rene was appointed Patron Saint of 
					Anaesthetists in 1951.
