					The patron saint of Lighthouse keepers is St. Venerius who died in the year 409. He was the second bishop of Milan (the first was St. Ambrose); friends with St. Paulinus of Nola, 
					Delphinus of Bordeaux, and Chromatius of Aquileia. He supported and defended the Council of Carthage in 401. St. Charles Borromeo brought his relics to the cathedral of Milan in 1579.

					It is not clear why Venerius is the patron of lighthouse keepers. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that St. Charles Borromeo once elevated his relics and placed them for all to see in 
					Milan's great cathedral. As a lighthouse guides the ships through the night, so an elevated saint is a sign and special comfort for all of the faithful. His feast day is May 4.
