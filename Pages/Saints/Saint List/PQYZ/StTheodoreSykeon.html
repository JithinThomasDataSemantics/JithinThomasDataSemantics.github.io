					Born in the Roman Galatian town of Sykeon in Asia Minor, Theodore was the son of a woman of ill repute, who kept an inn along the imperial highway.
					As a child, he was so given to prayer that he would often give up a meal to spend time in church. From an early age he shut himself up first in the cellar of his mother’s house and then in a cave beneath a disused chapel.
					Later, for a time, seeking to further escape the world, he sought solitude on a mountain.
				</p>
				<p>
					On a pilgrimage to Jerusalem Theodore assumed a monk’s habit, and though only eighteen years of age, was ordained a priest by his own bishop.
				</p>
				<p>
					His life was most austere, wearing an iron girdle about his body and only sparingly partaking of vegetables.
				</p>
				<p>
					Endowed with the gift of prophecy and miracles, on a second pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he obtained abundant rain after a severe drought.
				</p>
				<p>
					Theodore founded several monasteries, and ruled as abbot in Sykeon. He was consecrated Bishop of Anastasiopolis, though he deemed himself totally unfitted. After ten years he succeeded in relinquishing his post and retired to Sykeon.
				</p>
				<p>
					From Sykeon he was recalled to Constantinople to bless the emperor and the senate and there healed one of the Emperor’s sons of a skin disease, reputedly leprosy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Theodore had a great devotion to St. George and did much to propagate devotion to him.
				</p>
				<p>
					He died in Sykeon on April 22, 613.
