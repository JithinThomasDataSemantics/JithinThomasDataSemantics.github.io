					The holy martyrs, Saint Protus and Saint Hyacinth, during their lifetime were renowned for their dedicated zeal to the study of sacred Scripture.
				</p>
				<p>
					They were both in the service of blessed Eugenia – a Roman martyr, she also suffered martyrdom by sword for her faith, her feast day is 25 December - and they accompanied her to Rome.
				</p>
				<p>
					There they were killed during the persecution against Christians around 300AD. St Protus and St Hyacinth were offered the chance to recant Christ by making a sacrifice to the gods, but 
					as they refused, both were severely scourged and then beheaded on the 11 September.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pope Damasus I wrote an epitaph to honour these "brothers" after their death. The early Christian author, Tertullian remarked that: "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church". 
					Through the centuries, their sacrifice serves as the ultimate expression of faith.
