					Saint Ruadan was one of the twelve Apostles of Ireland, and an Abbot.  He was born in Leinster, Ireland.  He was a disciple of St. Finian of Clonard.  He went on and became the founder of 
					the Monastery of Lothra, in Tipperary, which was noted for having in excess of 150 Monks.  His date of death according the dictionary of saints states that he died on April 15, 584.   
					It is not known when he was born, but he is said to have died at the monastery of Lorrha, and his feast day is kept on the anniversary of his death.

					Saint Ruadan had the gift of prophecy, and he gave a prophecy that Diarmait, the high King of Ireland, would be killed by the roof beam of his hall at Tara.  Diarmait had the beam cast 
					into the sea.  Diarmait then asked his druids to find the manner of his death, and they foretold that he would die of slaughter, drowning and burning, and that the signs of his death 
					would be a shirt grown from a single seed of flax and a mantle of wool from a single sheep, ale brewed from one seed of corn, and bacon from a sow which had never farrowed.   While 
					traveling Ireland, King Diarmait came to the hall of Banban at Raith Bec, and there the fate of which he was warned came to pass.  The roof beam of Tara had been recovered from the sea 
					by Banban, and set in his hall, the shirt and mantle and ale and bacon are duly produced for Diarmait.  Diarmait goes to leave Banban's hall, but Aed Dub, waiting at the door, strikes 
					him down and sets fire to the hall.  Diarmait crawls into an ale vat to escape the flames and is duly killed by the falling room beam he had previously thrown to the sea!  All of the 
					prophecies were fulfilled.
