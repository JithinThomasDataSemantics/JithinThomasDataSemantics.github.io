					Saint Patapius was born in 380 in the Egyptian city of Thebes. His father was a governor of the region and a descendant of a well known Egyptian family. He and his wife were devout 
					Christians and instructed Patapius in Scripture. As Patapius reached a mature age, well-known tutors were brought from Alexandria to instruct him in science, mathematics, philosophy 
					and rhetoric. Through this education, he became accutely aware of how transient this world is and was attracted to the ascetical way of life. He was particularly inspired by Clement, 
					Origen and Athanasius. His father also took him to the renowned catechetical school in Alexandria where Patapius came under the influence of a blind teacher named Didemus. Didemus 
					inspired him even further to desire the ascetical path he had chosen. When he finished his studies, he returned to Thebes to find out that his father had passed away. Desiring to live 
					a life like the ascetics, he decided to leave for the Egyptian desert where he became well known for his ascetic deeds.
				</p>
				<p>
					No longer able to find peace in the desert he set off for Constantinople in 428. During his voyage, he met his disciple Sechnuti, who was an Egyptian rower.
					By 435, after seven years in Corinth, Patapius left his skete in the Geranian mountains to resume his journey to Constantinople taking with him the monk Sechnuti. In Constantinople, 
					they secretly went to the Monastery of Blachernae, where he obtained a cell in the city wall. Patapius kept his identity a secret and resumed a life of strict fasting, vigil and 
					prayer under the guise of a simple monk.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here he performed many miracles of healing. After a life adorned with virtue and miracles, he died at a great age of eighty-three in 463 and was buried by his disciples in the 
					church of St. John the Baptist in Constaninople of Petras (of Stone) which was under the protection of the royal family of Constantinople, Palaiologoi, and especially of Saint 
					Hipomoni (Saint Patience) who was the mother of the last emperor of Byzantium, Constantine Palaiologos.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the saint's repose, the Church has carefully preserved the stories of his life and his sacred relics. One thousand years after the repose of the saint, when the Turks captured 
					Constantinople, his relics where removed and taken to the little cave-skete in Corinth (as he had requested during his lifetime). The saint's body was hidden behind a western wall in 
					the cave facing the iconostasis and chapel they built.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the early 20th-century a local priest discovered the relics of the saint hidden in the wall. He was an unnaturally tall priest who regularly served this small chapel and because 
					of his height commissioned some changes to the chapel. The night before the works to the western wall were to commence, Fr. Constantine had a dream in which a monk warned him to "take 
					care when you break the wall because I am on the other side. I am Saint Patapius of Egypt." He was found the next day holding a large wooden cross on his chest, a parchment scroll 
					with his identity and large leaves covering his relics as fresh as they had been picked that very moment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since his relics have been discovered, many people have been visited by the saint in visions and dreams asking them to visit "his house in Loutraki". He is especially known for 
					healing cancer and miracles occur world-wide throughout the world, including Australia and America.
