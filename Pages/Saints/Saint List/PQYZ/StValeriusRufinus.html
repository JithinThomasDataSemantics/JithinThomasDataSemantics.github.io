					Saints Valerius and Rufinus (died 287 AD) are venerated as Christian saints and martyrs. Their legend states that they were imperial tax collectors in Soissons who were pious 
					Christians. They were ordered to be arrested by Rictius Varus, the praefectus-praetorii in Gaul. The two saints hid themselves (tradition holds in a cave in a forest near Soissons) but 
					were eventually caught, and then tortured and beheaded on the high road leading to Soissons.

					Saint Rufinus is one of the 140 Colonnade saints which adorn Saint Peter's Square in Vatican City.
