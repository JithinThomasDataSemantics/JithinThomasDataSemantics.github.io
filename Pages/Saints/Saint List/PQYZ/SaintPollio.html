					Cardinal Orsi relates that in the city of Cibales, Saint Pollio was presented to the governor, Probus, who asked him whether he was a Christian. Pollio answered that he was indeed a 
					Christian, and the chief of the Lectors. Probus asked:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Of what Lectors?"
				</p>
				<p>
					The saint replied:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Of those who read the Word of God to the people."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Of those, perhaps," added Probus, "who are in the habit of seducing silly women, persuading them to refrain from marriage, and to observe a foolish continency?"
				</p>
				<p>
					Pollio rejoined, "Those, instead, are foolish who abandon their Creator, to follow thy superstitions; on the contrary, they are wise who, notwithstanding their tortures, persevere in 
					the observance of the commandments."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Of whose commandments speakest thou?" Saint Probus asked.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Of those that teach us to adore one only God, and not gods made of stone or wood: that teach sinners to be converted, and the virtuous to persevere - that teach virgins their exalted 
					dignity, and married persons the observance of modesty - that teach subjects to obey, and legislators to command just things; finally, I speak of those commandments that teach us to 
					aspire to eternal life, and to despise the death that thou canst inflict upon us."
				</p>
				<p>
					"But what happiness," Probus asked, "can a man hope for, who, with life, has lost the enjoyment of light, and all the pleasures of the world?"
				</p>
				<p>
					The saint answered, "There is an eternal light incalculably better than this! Happiness which never ends is, beyond comparison, preferable to that which shortly terminates; and isn't it 
					prudent to prefer eternal enjoyments to those that quickly fail?"
				</p>
				<p>
					Probus interrupted the saint's discourse, saying, "What do these words avail? Do that which the emperor hath commanded - sacrifice to the gods."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Do thou that which hath been commanded thee," Pollio said, "I will not sacrifice, for it is written, â€˜He that sacrifices to devils, and not to God, shall be exterminated.'"
				</p>
				<p>
					"Then," Probus said, "Thou shalt be decapitated."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Execute thy orders," Pollio said placidly. "I am obliged to follow the doctrine which my fathers and bishops have taught me; I shall suffer with joy whatever thou mayest inflict."
				</p>
				<p>
					Probus was so enraged that, instead of ordering his decapitation, he condemned Saint Pollis to be burned alive.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the saint was led to the place of execution, he offered himself as a sacrifice to god, and blessed his holy name for making him die a martyr for His glory. He suffered courageously 
					on the 27th or 28th of April, in the year 304.
