				<p>
					Daughter of Saint Richard the King. Sister of Saint Willibald and Saint Winebald. Student of Saint Tatta at Wimborne monastery, Dorset, England, where she later became a nun.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beginning in 748, she evangelized and healed pagans in what is now Germany with Saint Lioba, Saint Boniface, and her brothers, a mission that was very successful. Abbess of communities 
					of men and of women at Heidenheim. Cures are ascribed to the oil that exudes from a rock on which her relics were placed, which together with her healing skills in life explains her 
					patronage of plague, rabies, coughs, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					The night of 1 May, the date of the translation of Walburga's relics to Eichst√§tt in 870, is known as Walpurgisnacht; it is also a pagan festival marking the beginning of summer and the 
					revels of witches. Though the saint had no connection with this festival, her name became associated with witchcraft and country superstitions because of the date. It is possible that 
					the protection of crops ascribed to her, represented by three ears of corn in her icons, may have been transferred to her from Mother Earth and the connection to this pagan holiday.
					She is the  patron of Boatmen , Farmers , Harvests , Mariners , Sailors , Watermen,, Against Coughs ,  Against Famine , Against Hydrophobia , Against Mad dogs,
					Against Plague , Against Rabies , Against Storms. She is also the patron against Dog Bites along with St Hubert of Liege,St Vitus, and Ubald.
