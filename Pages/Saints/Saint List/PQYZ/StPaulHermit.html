					St. Paul the Hermit was forced to flee to the desert to survive, but ended up living there an amazingly long time.
					Paul was born around the year 230 in Egypt to an upper-class Christian family. He was well-educated, but left an orphan at the age of 15. The persecutions of Decius began a few years 
					later, and members of his family planned a scheme to seize control of his property by reporting him as a Christian to the authorities. He fled both his family and the authorities by 
					going into the desert and living in a cave.

					The hermitic lifestyle suited Paul well and he spent the rest of his 113 year-long life surviving off fruit and water and wearing leaves. He spent most of his time in prayer, and a 
					legend tells of a raven bringing him bread for sustenance.
				</p>
				<p>
					St. Anthony the Abbot, who is traditionally credited with formalizing the monastic movement, visited Paul and became friends with him. (In fact, Anthony's feast day lands in two days.) 
					When he died, Anthony buried Paul in a cloak that was given to him by St. Athanasius, and it is said that two lions helped dig the grave. The two friends--Paul and Anthony--are depicted 
					in murals in the Basilica on opposite-facing walls. St. Paul's image includes the bread-bearing raven, and his relics rest in the reliquary chapel in the Basilica.
