					Saint Servatius was born in Armenia during the fourth century and was said to be a distant relative to Our Savior and to Saint John the Baptist.
				</p>
				<p>
					Servatius became a priest and guardian of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. While in Jerusalem, he had a vision in which he was ordered to go to Tongres to succeed Bishop Valentine. 
					Servatius had been bishop of Tongres for several years when the Huns threatened to invade the city. In 382, as a refuge, Servatius took a pilgrimage to Rome where he had another vision. 
					Saint Peter told him that Tongres would be destroyed and to move his see to Maastricht. Peter also handed Servatius the key to the Gates of Heaven, which gave him the power to forgive 
					sins, and to open or lock the Gates.
				</p>
				<p>
					No more than a few days after his relocation to Maastricht, Servatius fell ill with fever from an infection in his leg. He died on May 13, 384.
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint Servatius is recognized today as the patron of those who suffer with foot or leg ailments along with St Peter. His feast day is May 13th.
