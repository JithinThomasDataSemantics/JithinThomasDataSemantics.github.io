				<p>
					Martyred prince of the Wends who denied the faith when his father was slain by Christian Saxons. He served in the army of King Canute of Denmark, married Canute's daughter, and became a 
					Christian again. Taking over his former lands, Gotteschalk brought in Saxon monks and built churches. He was murdered by agents of his brother-in-law at Lenzen on the Elbe River. There 
					is considerable doubt concerning Gotteschalk's martyrdom and sanctity.St. Gotteschalk (or Gottschalk) was the son of Udo, the prince of Abrodites. St. Gotteschalk  was sent away to the 
					monastic school of St. Michael in Lenzen, Pomerania. He was murdered in that town along with 29 other missionaries on June 7, 1066.

					He is the patron of languages, linguists, lost vocations, princes and translators. His Feast is celebrated on June 7.
