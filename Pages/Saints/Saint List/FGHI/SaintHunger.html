					Saint Hunger was also know as Hungerus Frisus, and was the Bishop of Utrecht from 854 to 866. We are not sure when he was born.  
					After the death of his predecessor Luidger of Utrecht, Luidgerâ€™s nephew Craft, was offered the seat.  However, Craft, a very wealthy person, refused because he was afraid 
					that he would attract Viking raids.

					Instead the Canon, Saint Hunger was appointed.  At first, his relations with the Vikings were peaceful, but eventually Utrecht was threatened by the Vikings, at which the Bishop and the 
					entire clergy of Utrecht fled to Saint Odilienberg, near Roermond.  In 858 King Lothair II made a monastery available for them.  Later, the bishop settled in Prum and then in Deventer.

					By all accounts, Saint Hunger was a Godly man, who unlike his predecessors, did not engage in nepotism.  In the case of the childless marriage between King Lotharius and his wife, he 
					defended the sanctity of their marriage on Biblical and theological grounds.  To secure his succession, Lothair repudiated his wife and married Waldrada, with whom he had a son.  St. 
					Hunger Died in Prum, Germany, and his feast is December 22nd.
