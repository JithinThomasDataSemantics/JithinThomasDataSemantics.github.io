					It's been said that youth is wasted on the young. In some ways, that was true for today's saint.
				</p>
				<p>
					Born in France in the early fifth century, Hilary came from an aristocratic family. In the course of his education he encountered his relative, Honoratus, who encouraged the young man 
					to join him in the monastic life. Hilary did so. He continued to follow in the footsteps of Honoratus as bishop. Hilary was only 29 when he was chosen bishop of Arles.
				</p>
				<p>
					The new, youthful bishop undertook the role with confidence. He did manual labor to earn money for the poor. He sold sacred vessels to ransom captives. He became a magnificent orator. 
					He traveled everywhere on foot, always wearing simple clothing.
				</p>
				<p>
					That was the bright side. Hilary encountered difficulty in his relationships with other bishops over whom he had some jurisdiction. He unilaterally deposed one bishop. He selected 
					another bishop to replace one who was very illâ€“but, to complicate matters, did not die! Pope Saint Leo the Great kept Hilary a bishop but stripped him of some of his powers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hilary died at 49. He was a man of talent and piety who, in due time, had learned how to be a bishop.
