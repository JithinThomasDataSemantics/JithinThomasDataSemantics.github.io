					St. Francis de Morales was a  Dominican martyr of Japan.  He was a native of Madrid, Spain, and served for two decades in Satsuma, Japan.  In 1614 he went o Nagasaki, and was burned 
					alive with Blessed Charles Spinola and his companions.

					The shogunate and imperial governments at first supported the Catholic mission and the missionaries.  Their thinking was that they would reduce the power of the Buddhist monks, and 
					ultimately help their trade with Spain and Portugal.  However, they were weary that the Spanish would take power, converting the population.  The government increasingly seen Roman 
					Catholicism as a threat, and started persecuting Christians.  Christianity was banned, and those that refused to abandon their faith, were killed.

					On February 5, 1597, twenty-six Christians, six European Franciscan missionaries, three Japanese Jesuits and seventeen Japanese laymen including three young boys, were executed by 
					crucifixion in Nagasaki.  These individuals were raised on crosses and then pierced through, with spears.  This continued sporadically, through 1632.  In September 1632, fifty five 
					Christians were martyred in Nagasaki in what became known as the Great Genna Martyrdom.  By now, Roman Catholicism was officially outlawed.  The Church remained without clergy and 
					theological teaching disintegrated until the arrival of Western missionaries in the nineteenth century.  
				</p>
				<p>
					These martyrs were canonized by the Roman Catholic Church on June 8, 1862 by Blessed Pius IX and are listed on the Church Calendar.  It is not known how many Christians were executed in 
					Japan as records were either destroyed or not kept.
