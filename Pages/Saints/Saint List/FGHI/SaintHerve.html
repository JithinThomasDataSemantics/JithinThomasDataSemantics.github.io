					Son of the bard Hyvarnion, Herve was born blind. His father died when Herve was an infant, his mother, Rivanone, became an anchoress, and the boy was entrusted to the care of his uncles 
					and a renowned holy man with whom he stayed until his teenage years. He lived for a while as a hermit and bard, then joined a monastic school at Plouvien, France which had been founded 
					by his uncle. Abbot at Plouvien. He migrated with part of his community to found a new house in Lanhouarneau. Singer. Minstrel. Teacher. Miracle worker. One of the most popular saints 
					in Brittany, he figures in the area's folklore. Reported to have a special ministry of healing animals, and to have a domesticated wolf as a companion. Legend says that the wolf killed 
					and ate the ox that Herve used to plow his fields; Herve then preached such a moving sermon the wolf repented his ways, moved to Herve's hermitage, and ploughed Herve's fields in place 
					of the ox.
