					Third Order Carmelite Saint included in the Roman Martyrology
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint George was born in Valletta, the capital of the Mediterranean island of Malta, and lived for a time in Valletta near the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. As a child, and 
					according to the customs of the times, George joined the Carmelite Family by being enrolled in the Scapular. As a young man he felt called to the priesthood. He was ordained priest on 
					22 December 1906. During the early months of 1907, the young Fr George began his mission by gathering around him and forming a small group of young men in their twenties. He instilled 
					in them moral principles, the fear of God and an awareness of the infinite love that God bears humanity. These young men were the first seeds of the Society of Christian Doctrine, 
					popularly known as MUSEUM, the initial letters of Magister, Utinam Sequatur Evangelium Universus Mundus ("Lord, would that the whole world follow the Gospel"). Fr. George's work was and 
					is the religious education of young children, boys and girls and youth, undertaken by well-prepared lay people. The central theme of his spirituality and theology was the Incarnation: 
					Verbum Dei caro factum est ("The Word of God was made flesh"). These words became the motto of the distinctive emblem of the Society and of his life. Fr George was not satisfied with a 
					minimal Christian life. As a child he wore the scapular and in later years wanted to commit himself more intensely to following the example of Our Lady and thus became a Carmelite 
					Tertiary. He joined the Third Order on 21 July 1918 and made his profession on 26 September of the following year. At his profession he took the name of "Franco", after the Carmelite 
					Blessed Franco of Siena. Fr George chose the name of this Blessed because he considered himself a great sinnerâ€¦ a characteristic of many saints. He really felt he was a member of the 
					Carmelite Family, so much so that several times in his writings he calls himself a Carmelite and uses the name he took at his profession as a Tertiary rather than his own name. In 1952, 
					in recognition of his untiring efforts to spread devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Fr George was affiliated to the Order. He died at 82, on 26 July 1962. His presence and the 
					influence of his spirit are still felt among all Maltese families.
