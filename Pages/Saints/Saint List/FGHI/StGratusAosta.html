					It is thought that both Gratus and Eustasius were of Greek origin and that they received their education and ecclesiastical formation from the type of monastic foundation in Italy 
					established by Eusebius of Vercelli, which was modeled on that of the Eastern cenobites.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gratus became bishop of Aosta sometime after 451, and presided over the translation of various relics in the city around 470, including those of Saint Innocent, one of the martyrs of 
					the Theban Legion. The bishops of Agaunum and Sion were present at this translation.
				</p>
				<p>
					His feast day is September 7. The diffusion of Gratus' cult occurred in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when his relics were translated from the Paleochristian St. Laurence church 
					(in Aosta) to the collegiate church of Sant'Orso. Some of his relics lie there still, in a gold and silver reliquary.
				</p>
				<p>
					One March 27 of an uncertain year, a liturgical feast was introduced in the diocese of Aosta that honored the translation of Gratus' relics. An ancient ritual of pagan origin consisted 
					of a blessing of the earth, the water, and the candles, coinciding with the coming of spring. During the Middle Ages, Gratus was invoked against a series of natural disasters: floods 
					caused by the melting of the winter snows; drought; hailstones; fire; grasshoppers and moles that devastated the fields. As a thaumaturgus, he was invoked against witches and devils.
