					Hippolytus was born in Rome in the 2nd century. Hippolytus was a military leader and the overseer of the prisons in Rome. The Roman Emperor Valerian (c.200 - 260) who reigned from from 
					253 to 260 became wary of the growing power of the Christians and mounted a persecution against them. Those arrested had no trial and were sentenced to death and then thrown into pits 
					without proper burials. Hippolytus was converted to Christianity by Saint Lawrence who was imprisoned in 258 and placed under his jurisdiction. Whilst in prison Hippolytus witnessed 
					Saint Lawrence healing the sick. When Saint Lawrence was martyred Hippolytus ensured that he was given a Christian burial. Hippolytus became interested in the writings of Saint 
					Irenaeus, whose writings were formative in the early development of Christian theology. Saint Hippolytus became famous as one of the most prolific writers of the early Christian 
					Church. Various conflicts with the popes of the time led to Hippolytus being referred to as the first Anti-pope. The issues were eventually resolved and he became a prelate, a high 
					ranking member of the clergy with authority over other clergy.  Hippolytus probably died under the rule of the Roman Emperor Diocletian (r.284-305). Emperor Diocletian mounted some of 
					the fiercest persecutions of the early Church especially in the East of the Empire.  and he was martyred by being bound by the feet to the tails of two wild horses and dragged to his 
					death.
