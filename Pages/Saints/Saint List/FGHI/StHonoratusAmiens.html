					Saint Honoratus of Amiens was born in Port-le-Grand near Amiens to a noble family. He was said to be virtuous from birth. 
					He was taught by his predecessor in the bishopric of Amiens, Saint Beatus .
					Honoratus resisted being elected bishop of Amiens, believing himself unworthy of this honor. According to hagiographic tradition, a ray of light of divine origin descended upon his 
					head upon his election as bishop. There also appeared holy oil of unknown origin on his forehead.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to a legend, when it was known in his hometown that he had been proclaimed bishop, his nursemaid, who was baking bread for the family, refused to believe that Honoratus had 
					been elevated to such a position. She remarked that she would believe the news only if the peel she had been using to bake bread put down roots and turned itself into a tree. When the 
					peel was placed into the ground, it was transformed into a mulberry tree that gave flowers and fruit. This miraculous tree was still being shown in the sixteenth century.
				</p>
				<p>
					During his bishopric, he discovered the relics of Victoricus, Fuscian, and Gentian, which had remained hidden for 300 years.
				</p>
				<p>
					His devotion was widespread in France following reports of numerous miracles when his body was exhumed in 1060.
				</p>
				<p>
					After his death, his relics were invoked against drought. Bishop Guy, son of the Count of Amiens, ordered that a procession be held, in which an urn holding Honoratus' relics were 
					carried around the walls of the city. Rain is said to have fallen soon after. In 1240, during construction of the cathedral of Amiens, the relics of Honoratus were 
					carried through the surrounding countryside in a quest for funds.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1202, a baker named Renold Theriens (Renaud Cherins) donated to the city of Paris some land to build a chapel in honor of the saint. The chapel became one of the richest in Paris, 
					and gave its name to Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©. In 1400, the bakers of Paris established their guild in the church of Saint Honoratus, celebrating his feast on 16 May and spreading 
					his cult.
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint Honoratus is the patron of bakers, confectioners, bakers of altar bread, candle-makers, florists, flour merchants, corn chandlers, oil refiners, and pastry chefs.
					He is also the patron of a Carthusian establishment at Abbeville, which was founded in 1306.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1659, Louis XIV ordered that every baker observe the feast of Saint Honoratus, and give donations in honor of the saint and for the benefit of the community.
