					Saint Friard was born about the year 511, of a family of plowmen, according to our Nantes traditions. Saint Gregory of Tours wrote his life and it is to him that we owe almost all that 
					we know today about the servant of God. The youth of Blessed Friar was chaste and pious. He loved prayer, the song of divine praise, the holy vigils, and while he was laboring in the 
					fields with his companions, he did not cease to pray and raise his heart to God. This holy life was often ridiculed by the people of the country; But Saint Friard bore with patience the 
					ridicule and followed the movements of grace with docility. His favorite prayer was this verse of Holy Scripture: Our help is in the name of the Lord, Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Dei . 
					He had this word on his lips; It was his consolation and strength in the midst of daily hardships. Saint Gregory of Tours has preserved some details full of naivete about this period of 
					the life of Blessed Friar.

					Saint Friard lived long in solitude. Like all saints, he put his virtue under the protection of humility. "One day," says Saint Gregory of Tours, "he picked up the branch of a tree 
					planted by him, which the wind had broken, and he made a stick of it which he carried in his hand. Long enough after, he put the stick in the ground, watered it often, and the dried 
					branch, beginning to grow again, produced flowers and fruits. At the end of two or three years it had become a great tree. The neighboring people admired this marvelous tree, and an 
					immense crowd flocked every day to see it, so that they spoke far off of the virtue of the servant of God. Saint Friard was afraid of being seduced by vain glory; He took an ax and cut 
					the tree he had planted.

					The tombs of Saint Friard and Saint Seeondel are still to be seen today in the church of Besn√©. These stone tombs, as are many of the same period in our country, are placed in the crypt 
					of the new church. Several fragments of the bones of the two saints, which may have been removed from the revolutionary profanations , are also preserved there .
