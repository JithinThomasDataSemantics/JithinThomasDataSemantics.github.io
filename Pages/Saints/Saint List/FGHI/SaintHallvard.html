					According to tradition, Hallvard was a Norwegian, son of Vebjorn of Husaby. In 1043, as he was about to cross the Drammenfjord in a boat, a woman ran up to him, begging his help; she 
					claimed she was falsely accused of theft, and feared for her life. Hallvard took her aboard, but the pursuers reached them before he could push off. They demanded he give her up, but he 
					refused, saying the woman swore she was innocent. One of the pursuers shot and killed both Hallvard and the woman with a bow. The mob attached a stone to Hallvard's body and threw it 
					into the sea; it floated, and was later enshrined at Christ Church, Oslo, Norway. Revered as a martyr because he died in defense of innocence, in the best spirit of chivalry.

					He is the patron for protection of innocence and protection of virtue. His feast is celebrated on May 15.
