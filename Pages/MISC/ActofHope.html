				<p><b>Prayer</b></p>
				<p><i>
				O my God, relying on your infinite mercy and promises, I hope to obtain pardon of my sins, the help of your grace, and life everlasting, through the merits of Jesus Christ, my Lord and 
				Redeemer. 
				Amen.

				An Act of Hope is a very good prayer for school-aged children. Encourage your children to memorize it so that they can pray the Act of Hope before taking a test. While there is no 
				substitute for study, it is good for students to realize that they don't have to rely on their own strength alone.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Act of Hope from the 1885 Baltimore Catechism is very easy to learn. The virtue of hope is often overlooked today, but it is precisely the antidote to so many people today losing 
				hope in their lives.
				</p>
				<p>
				The virtue of hope neither despairs or presumes.
				</p>
				<p>
				Those who do not have or practice the Catholic Faith can fall prey to these sins of despair and presumption. Sometimes all we need to do is make a mental act to know that "all is not 
				lost", but few of us can do this without the Catholic Faith and constant prayer. This prayer helps us gain the graces necessary to have hope.
				</p>
				<p>
				Children need to know this prayer and its virtue so that they enter life prepared to count on God's promises when the need arises.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Act of Hope reminds us what our Faith will provide in the end.
				</p>
				<p>
				"If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever" (John 14:15,16). 
				</p>
				<p>
				It helps to run the race when one has the goal in mind, especially on the very Word of Jesus Himself!
