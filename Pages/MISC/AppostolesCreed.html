				<p><b>Appostoles Creed as the 12 fundamental trurths</b></p>
				<p><i>
					1) I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth <br/>
					2) And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord <br/>
					3) Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary <br/>

					6) He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty<br/>
					7) From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead<br/>
					8) I believe in the Holy Ghost<br/>

					10) The forgiveness of sins<br/>
					11) The resurrection of the Body<br/>
					12) And the life everlasting. Amen</i>

				The name of this creed does not point to apostolic authorship, but rather to the fact that it summarizes briefly the fundamental truths of Scripture as given to us through the apostles. 
				In its simplest form the creed probably originated in the early part of the second century and arose in connection with the instruction of catechumens in preparation for baptism. In its 
				present form this creed is probably of no earlier date than the latter part of the fifth century. It is the best known of the ecumenical creeds; and it gives simple, brief, and yet full 
				expression to our "catholic, undoubted Christian faith."
				</p>
				<p>
				The creed is trinitarian, in that by it one confesses his faith in God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. It is a confession of the factual history of the gospel. It is also 
				our confession.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Apostles' Creed has been used in the Christian church for public confession of faith, instruction and teaching for centuries. It has been used within the more developed confessions 
				of later Christian ages, such as the Heidelberg Catechism to form a basis for systematic instruction along with the law and the Lord's Prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
				As a creed it is the original and complete statement of the fundamentals of the faith. It also has certain elements of doctrine inherent in it. It confesses, though briefly, the 
				sovereignty of God as almighty, the truth of creation, the virgin birth, bodily resurrection from the dead of Christ and His people.
				</p>
				<p>
				It also takes the historic Christian position on Christ's return, which is one coming from heaven to judge the living and the dead, with the implication of one resurrection, both of the 
				righteous and the wicked.
				</p>
				<p>
				This is stated in yet fuller form in the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed. The Nicene Creed adds to the coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead, "whose kingdom shall have 
				no end," that is, that Christ's kingdom is an eternal kingdom. The Athanasian Creed adds "(40) From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. (41) At whose coming all men 
				shall rise again with their bodies; (42) And shall give account of their own works. (43) And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into 
				everlasting fire."
				</p>
				<p>
				Yet all three, beginning with the Apostles' Creed, take the doctrinal position of one final coming of Christ, resurrection, judgment, and final kingdom. The Apostles' Creed and the 
				others with it point to the fact that from the earliest times any form of earthly millennial theory was excluded. Pre-millennialism and post-millennialsim are not authentic Christian 
				doctrine; they are not confessional historic Christianity.
