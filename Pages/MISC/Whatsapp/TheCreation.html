				God was in the process of creating the universe. And he was explaining to his subordinates.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Look everything should be in balance. For example, after every 10 deer there should be a lion.
				</p>
				<p>
				Look here my fellow angels, here is the country of the United States. I have blessed them with prosperity and money. But at the same time I have given them insecurity and tension....
				</p>
				<p>
				And here is Africa. I have given them beautiful nature. But at the same time, I have given them climatic extremes.
				</p>
				<p>
				And here is South America.. I have given them lots of forests. But at the same time, I have given them lesser land so that they would have to cut off the forests....
				</p>
				<p>
				So you see fellows, everything should be in balance."
				</p>
				<p>
				One of the angels asked... "God, what is this extremely beautiful country here?"
				</p>
				<p>
				God said..."Ahah...that is the crown piece of all. INDIA, My most precious creation. It has understanding and friendly People. Sparkling streams and serene mountains. A culture 
				which speaks of the great tradition that they live. Technologically brilliant and with a heart of gold....."
				</p>
				<p>
				The angel was quite surprised: "But God you said everything should be in balance."
				</p>
				<p>
				God replied â€” "Look at the politicians and the neighbours I gave them."
