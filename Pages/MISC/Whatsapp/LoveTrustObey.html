				You cannot love someone that you do not know, and you cannot know someone that you don't spend quality time with.
				</p>
				<p>
				To know Jesus is to love Him. To love Him is to trust Him. To trust Him is to obey Him. To obey Him is to be blessed. It begins with a daily, quality communication with the Lord.
				</p>
				<p>
				Why is it best to spend time with the Lord in the morning? Because you are getting ready to go on a road trip through life. You don't take the trip and then read the map, do you?
				</p>
				<p>
				How are you starting your mornings? With a cup of coffee and the paper? Or with the pure milk of the Word and the light of His presence?
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my sighing.
				Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.
				In the morning, O LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation. -- Psalm 5:1-3</b>
