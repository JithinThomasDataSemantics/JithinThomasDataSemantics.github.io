				A country preacher decided to skip services one Sunday to spend the day hiking in the wilderness. Rounding a sharp bend in the trail, he collided with a bear and was sent tumbling 
				down a steep grade. He landed on a rock and broke both legs.
				</p>
				<p>
				With the ferocious bear charging at him from a distance, the preacher prayed, "O Lord, I'm so sorry for skipping services today. Please forgive me and grant me just one wish-make a 
				Christian out of that bear that's coming at me!"
				</p>
				<p>
				At that very instant, the bear skidded to a halt, fell to his knees, clasped his paws together, and began to pray aloud at the preacher's feet: "Dear God, please bless this food I am 
				about to receive."
