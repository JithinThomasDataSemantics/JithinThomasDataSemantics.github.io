				<p>
				To my dearest family, some things I'd like to say,
				But first of all to let you know that I arrived okay.
				I'm writing this from Heaven, where I dwell with God above,
				Where there are no tears or sadness, there is just eternal Love.
				</p>
				<p>
				Please do not be unhappy, just because I'm out of sight,
				Remember that I'm with you, every morning, noon and night.
				That day I had to leave you, when my life on earth was through,
				God picked me up and hugged me, and said, " I welcome you".
				</p>
				<p>
				"It's good to have you back again.
				You were missed while you were gone.
				As for your dearest family, they'll be here later on.
				I need you here so badly as part of my big plan.
				There's so much that we have to do, to help our mortal man".
				</p>
				<p>
				Then God gave me a list of things he wished for me to do.
				And foremost on that list of mine, is to watch and care for you.
				I will be beside you, every day of the week and year,
				And when you're sad I'm standing there, to wipe away the tear.
				</p>
				<p>
				And when you lie in bed at night, the day's chores put to flight,
				God and I are closest to you in the middle of the night.
				When you think of my life on Earth, and all those loving years,
				Because you're only human, there's bound to be some tears.
				</p>
				<p>
				One thing is for certain, though my life on Earth is over,
				I am closer to you now than I ever was before.
				And to my many friends, trust God knows what is best.
				I am not far away from you, I'm just beyond the crest.
				</p>
				<p>
				There are rocky roads ahead for you and many hills to climb,
				Together we can do it, taking one day at a time.
				It was my philosophy and please I'd like for you,
				To give unto the world, so the world will give to you.
				</p>
				<p>
				If you can help someone who's in sorrow or in pain,
				Then you can say to God at night, my day was not in vain.
				And now I am contented that my life it was worthwhile,
				Knowing as I passed along the way, I made somebody smile.
				</p>
				<p>
				When you're walking down the street and I am on your mind,
				I'm walking in your footsteps, only half a step behind.
				And when you feel a gentle breeze of wind upon your face,
				That's me giving you a great big hug, or just a s oft embrace.
				</p>
				<p>
				When it's time for you to go from that body to be free,
				Remember you are not going, you are coming home to me.
				I will always love you, from that place way up above,
				I will be in touch again soon.<br/>
				P.S. God sends his love.
