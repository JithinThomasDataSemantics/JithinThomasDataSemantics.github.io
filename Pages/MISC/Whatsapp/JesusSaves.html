				Jesus and Satan were having an ongoing argument about who managed to get the most out of his computer. This had been going on for days and God said, "Cool it. I am going to set up a 
				test that will run two hours and I will judge who does the better job."
				</p>
				<p>
				So down they sat at the keyboards and typed away. They moused away. They did spreadsheets, they wrote reports, they sent faxes, they sent out e-mail, they sent out e-mail with 
				attachments, they downloaded, they did some genealogy reports, they made cards, they did every known job.
				</p>
				<p>
				But just a few minutes before the two hours were up, a lightning bolt flashed across the sky. The thunder rolled and the rains came down hard. And of course the electricity went off.
				</p>
				<p>
				Satan was furious. He fumed and fussed and he ranted and raved. All to no avail. The electricity stayed off.
				</p>
				<p>
				But after a bit, the rains stopped and the electricity came back on.
				</p>
				<p>
				Satan screamed, "I lost it all when the power went off! What am I going to do? What happened to Jesus' work?"
				</p>
				<p>
				Jesus just sat and smiled.
				</p>
				<p>
				Again Satan asked about the work that Jesus had done.
				</p>
				<p>
				As Jesus turned his computer back on, the screen glowed and when he pushed "print," it was all there.
				</p>
				<p>
				"How did he do it?" Satan asked.
				</p>
				<p>
				God smiled and said, "Jesus Saves."
