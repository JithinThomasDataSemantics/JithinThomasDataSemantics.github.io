					Listen to this conversation between twins inside the womb of their mother.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 1: And you, you believe in life after birth?
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 2: Absolutely. It's obvious that life after birth exist. We are here to become stronger and to get ready for Whatever awaits us next.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 1: This is absurd. There is nothing after birth! What would life look like outside the womb?
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 2: Well, there are many stories about the other side. I've heard there is a blaze of light there, an intense and profound feeling of joy with deep emotions, thousands of things to live for... For example, I've heard that we'll eat with our mouth, there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 1: That's silly. We have an umbilical cord and that is how we eat. Everyone knows that we don't use our mouth to eat! And, on the top of it, no one has ever come back from the other world... Those stories are all coming from naive people. Life just ends at birth. Period. That's the way it is and we must accept it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 2: Alright, then allow me to think differently. That's for sure, I have no idea what life after birth looks like, and I can't prove anything to you. But I like to believe, that in the next world, we'll be able to see our mother and that she will take care of us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 1: "Mother"? You mean that you believe in 'Mother'? Oh! So where is she?
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 2: Everywhere, don't you see it! She is everywhere, all around us. We are part of her and it's thanks to her that we are living right now. Without her, we wouldn't be here.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 1: This is ridiculous! I've never seen any mother so it's obvious that she doesn't exist.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baby 2: I don't agree, that's your way of seeing things. Because sometimes when everything quiets down a little bit, we can hear her sing. We can feel her hugging our world. I'm pretty sure that our life will start after birth.
				</p>
				<p><br/>
					â€¬Now please read the same conversation a second time, by interchanging the following words:
				</p>
				<p>
					BIRTH  to  DEATH<br/>
					WOMB  to  WORLD<br/>
					MOTHER  to  GOD<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					Then you will find a mystery unveiling...
