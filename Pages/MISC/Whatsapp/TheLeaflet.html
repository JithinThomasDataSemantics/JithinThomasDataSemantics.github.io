				Every Sunday afternoon, after the morning service at their church, the Preacher and his 11-year-old son would go out into their town and hand out Gospel tracts. This particular Sunday 
				afternoon, as it came time for the Preacher and his son to go to the streets with their tracts, it was very cold outside as well as pouring down rain. The boy bundled up in his warmest 
				and driest clothes and said "Okay Dad, I'm ready."
				</p>
				<p>
				His Preacher Dad asked, "Ready for what?
				</p>
				<p>
				"Dad, it's time we gather our tracts together and go out."
				</p>
				<p>
				Dad responds, "Son, it's very cold outside and it's pouring down rain."
				</p>
				<p>
				The boy gives his Dad a surprised look, asking, "But Dad, aren't people still going to Hell, even though it's raining?"
				</p>
				<p>
				Dad answers, "Son, I am not going out in this weather."
				</p>
				<p>
				Despondently the boy asks, "Dad, can I go -- Please?"
				</p>
				<p>
				His father hesitated for a moment then said, "Son, you can go. Here's the tracts; be careful son."
				</p>
				<p>
				"Thanks, Dad!" And with that he was off and out into the rain. This 11-year-old boy walked the streets of the town going door-to-door and handing everybody he met in the street a 
				Gospel tract. After 2-hours of walking in the rain he was soaking bone-chilled wet and down to his very last tract. He stopped on a corner and looked for someone to hand a tract to 
				but the streets were totally deserted.
				</p>
				<p>
				Then he turned toward the first home he saw and started up the sidewalk to the front door and rang the door bell. He rang the bell -- but nobody answered. He rang it again and again 
				bit still no one answered. He waited but still no answer. Finally this 11-year-old trooper turned to leave but something stopped him. Again, he turned to the door and rang the bell 
				and knocked loudly on the door with his fist. He waited, something holding him there on the front porch. He rang again, and this time the door slowly opened. Standing in the doorway 
				was a very sad looking elderly lady.
				</p>
				<p>
				She softly asked, "What can I do for you, son?"
				</p>
				<p>
				With radiant eyes and a smile that lit up her world, this little boy said, "Ma'am, I'm sorry if I disturbed you, but I just want to tell you that JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU! I came to 
				give you my very last Gospel tract which will tell you all about Jesus and His great love." With that he handed her his last tract, and turned to leave.
				</p>
				<p>
				She called to him as he departed, "Thank you, son! And God bless you!"
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, the following Sunday morning in church, Preacher Dad was in the pulpit and as the service began he asked, "Does anybody have a testimony or want to say anything?"
				</p>
				<p>
				Slowly, in the back row of the church, an elderly lady stood to her feet. As she began to speak, a look of glorious radiance came from her face. "None of you in this church know me. 
				I've never been here before. You see, before last Sunday I was not a Christian. My husband has passed on, some time ago, leaving me totally alone in this world. Last Sunday, being a 
				particularly cold and rainy day, it was even more so in my heart as I came to the end of the line where I no longer had any hope or will to live.
				</p>
				<p>
				"So I took a rope and a chair and ascended the stairway into the attic of my home. I fastened the rope securely to a rafter in the roof then stood on the chair and fastened the other 
				end of the rope around my neck. "Standing on that chair, so lonely and brokenhearted, I was about to leap off when suddenly the loud ringing of my doorbell downstairs startled me. I 
				thought, 'I'll wait a minute, and whoever it is will go away.' "I waited and waited -- but the ringing doorbell seemed to get louder and more insistent and then the person ringing 
				also started knocking loudly. I thought to myself again, 'Who on earth could this be?! Nobody ever rings my bell or comes to see me!' "I loosened the rope from my neck and started for 
				the front door, all the while the bell rang louder and louder. When I opened the door and looked I could hardly believe my eyes! "There on my front porch was the most radiant and 
				angelic little boy I had ever seen in my life! His smile! Oh, I could never describe it to you! And the words that came from his mouth caused my heart, that had long been dead, to 
				leap to life as he exclaimed with cherub-like voice, 'Ma'am, I just came to tell you that JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU.' "Then he gave me this Gospel tract that I now hold in my hand. 
				As the little angel disappeared back out, into the cold and rain, I closed my door and read slowly every word of this Gospel tract. Then I went up to my attic to get my rope and 
				chair. I wouldn't be needing them any more.
				</p>
				<p>
				"You see, I am now a happy child of the KING, and since the address of your church was on the back of this Gospel tract I have come here to personally say, 'Thank you to God's little 
				angel who came just in the nick of time, and by so doing, spared my soul from an eternity in Hell.'"
				</p>
				<p>
				There were now no dry eyes in the church. As shouts of praise and honor to the KING resounded off the very rafters of the building, Preacher Dad descended from the pulpit to the front 
				pew where the little angel was seated. He took him in his arms and sobbed uncontrollably.
				</p>
				<p>
				Probably no church has had a more glorious moment and probably this Universe has never seen a Papa that was more filled with love and honor for his son, except for one: This Father, 
				God, also allowed His Son, Jesus, to go out into a cold and dark world. He received His Son back with joy unspeakable, and as all of Heaven shouted praises and honor to the King, the 
				Father sat His beloved Son on a throne far above all principality and power and every name that is named. There may be someone, reading this, who is also going through a dark, cold 
				and lonely time in your soul. You may be a Christian, for we are not without problems, or you may not yet know the King. Whatever the case, and whatever the problem or situation you 
				find yourself in, and no matter how dark it may seem, I want you to know that I just came to tell you, "JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU!"
