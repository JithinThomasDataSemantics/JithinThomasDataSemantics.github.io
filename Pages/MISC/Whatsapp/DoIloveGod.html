				One day, I woke early in the morning to watch the sunrise.
				</p>
				<p>
				Ah the beauty of God's creation is beyond description.
				</p>
				<p>
				As I watched, I praised God for His beautiful work.
				</p>
				<p>
				As I sat there, I felt the Lord's presence with me.
				</p>
				<p>
				He asked me, "Do you love me?"
				</p>
				<p>
				I answered, "Of course, God! You are my Lord and Savior!"
				</p>
				<p>
				Then He asked, "If you were physically handicapped, would you still love me?"
				</p>
				<p>
				I was perplexed. I looked down upon my arms, legs and the rest of my body and wondered how many things I wouldn't be able to do, the things that I took for granted. And I answered, 
				"It would be tough Lord, but I would still love You."
				</p>
				<p>
				Then the Lord said, "If you were blind, would you still love my creation?"
				</p>
				<p>
				How could I love something without being able to see it? Then I thought of all the blind people in the world and how many of them still loved God and His creation.
				So I answered, "Its hard to think of it, but I would still love you."
				</p>
				<p>
				The Lord then asked me, "If you were deaf, would you still listen to my word?"
				</p>
				<p>
				How could I listen to anything being deaf? Then I understood. Listening to God's Word is not merely using our ears, but our hearts. I answered, "It would be tough, but I would still 
				listen to Your word."
				</p>
				<p>
				The Lord then asked, "If you were mute, would you still praise My Name?"
				</p>
				<p>
				How could I praise without a voice? Then it occurred to me: God wants us to sing from our very heart and soul. It never matters what we sound like. And praising God is not always with 
				a song, but when we are persecuted, we give God praise with our words of thanks. So I answered, "Though I could not physically sing, I would still praise Your Name.
				</p>
				<p>
				And the Lord asked, "Do you really love Me?"
				</p>
				<p>
				With courage and a strong conviction, I answered boldly, "Yes Lord! I love You because You are the one and true God!"
				</p>
				<p>
				I thought I had answered well, but...
				</p>
				<p>
				God asked, "THEN WHY DO YOU SIN?"
				</p>
				<p>
				I answered, "Because I am only human. I am not perfect."
				</p>
				<p>
				"THEN WHY IN TIMES OF PEACE DO YOU STRAY THE FURTHEST? WHY ONLY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE DO YOU PRAY THE EARNEST?"
				</p>
				<p>
				No answers. Only tears.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Lord continued: "Why only sing at fellowships and retreats? Why seek Me only in times of worship? Why ask things so selfishly? Why ask things so unfaithfully?"
				</p>
				<p>
				The tears continued to roll down my cheeks.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Why are you ashamed of Me? Why are you not spreading the good news? Why in times of persecution, you cry to others when I offer My shoulder to cry on? Why make excuses when I give 
				you opportunities to serve in My Name?"
				</p>
				<p>
				I tried to answer, but there was no answer to give.
				</p>
				<p>
				"You are blessed with life. I made you not to throw this gift away. I have blessed you with talents to serve Me, but you continue to turn away. I have revealed My Word to you, but you 
				do not gain in knowledge. I have spoken to you but your ears were closed. I have shown My blessings to you, but your eyes were turned away. I have sent you servants, but you sat idly 
				by as they were pushed away. I have heard your prayers and I have answered them all."
				</p>
				<p>
				"DO YOU TRULY LOVE ME ?"
				</p>
				<p>
				I could not answer. How could I? I was embarrassed beyond belief. I had no excuse. What could I say to this? When I my heart had cried out and the tears had flowed, I said, " Please 
				forgive me Lord. I am unworthy to be Your child."
				</p>
				<p>
				The Lord answered, "That is My Grace, My child."
				</p>
				<p>
				I asked, "Then why do you continue to forgive me? Why do You love me so?"
				</p>
				<p>
				The Lord answered, "Because you are My creation. You are my child. I will never abandon you."
				</p>
				<p>
				"When you cry, I will have compassion and cry with you.<br/>
				When you shout with joy, I will laugh with you.<br/>
				When you are down, I will encourage you.<br/>
				When you fall, I will raise you up.<br/>
				When you are tired, I will carry you.<br/>
				I will be with you till the end of days, and I will love you forever."
				</p>
				<p>
				Never had I cried so hard before. How could I have been so cold? How could I have hurt God as I had done? I asked God, "How much do You love me?"
				</p>
				<p>
				The Lord stretched out His arms, and I saw His nail-pierced hands. I bowed down at the feet of Christ, my Savior. And for the first time, I truly prayed.
