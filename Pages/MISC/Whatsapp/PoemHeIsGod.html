				He is the First and Last, the Beginning and the End!<br/>
				He is the keeper of Creation and the Creator of all!<br/>
				He is the Architect of the universe and<br/>
				The Manager of all times.<br/>
				He always was, He always is, and He always will be...<br/>
				Unmoved, Unchanged, Undefeated, and never Undone!<br/>
				He was bruised and brought healing!<br/>
				He was pierced and eased pain!<br/>
				He was persecuted and brought freedom!<br/>
				He was dead and brought life!<br/>
				He is risen and brings power!<br/>
				He reigns and brings Peace!<br/>
				The world can't understand him,<br/>
				The armies can't defeat Him,<br/>
				The schools can't explain Him, and <br/>
				The leaders can't ignore Him.<br/>
				Herod couldn't kill Him, <br/>
				The Pharisees couldn't confuse Him, and<br/>
				The people couldn't hold Him!<br/>
				Nero couldn't crush Him,<br/>
				Hitler couldn't silence Him,<br/>
				The New Age can't replace Him, and <br/>
				Donahue can't explain Him away!<br/>
				He is light, love, longevity, and Lord.<br/>
				He is goodness, Kindness, Gentleness, and God.<br/>
				He is Holy, Righteous, mighty, powerful, and pure.<br/>
				His ways are right,<br/>
				His word is eternal, <br/>
				His will is unchanging, and<br/>
				His mind is on me.<br/>
				He is my Redeemer,<br/>
				He is my Savior,<br/>
				He is my guide, and<br/>
				He is my peace!<br/>
				He is my Joy,<br/>
				He is my comfort,<br/>
				He is my Lord, and<br/>
				He rules my life!<br/>
				I serve Him because His bond is love,<br/>
				His burden is light, and <br/>
				His goal for me is abundant life.<br/>
				I follow Him because He is the wisdom of the wise,<br/>
				The power of the powerful,<br/>
				The ancient of days, the ruler of rulers,<br/>
				The leader of leaders, the overseer of the overcomers, and <br/>
				The sovereign Lord of all that was and is and is to come.<br/>
				And if that seems impressive to you, try this for size.<br/>
				His goal is a relationship with ME!<br/>
				He will never leave me, <br/>
				Never forsake me,<br/>
				Never mislead me, <br/>
				Never forget me,<br/>
				Never overlook me, and<br/>
				Ever cancel my appointment in His appointment book!<br/>
				When I fall, He lifts me up!<br/>
				When I fail, He forgives!<br/>
				When I am weak, He is strong!<br/>
				When I am lost, He is the way!<br/>
				When I am afraid, He is my courage!<br/>
				When I stumble, He steadies me!<br/>
				When I am hurt, He heals me!<br/>
				When I am broken, He mends me!<br/>
				When I am blind, He leads me!<br/>
				When I am hungry, He feeds me!<br/>
				When I face trials, He is with me!<br/>
				When I face persecution, He shields me!<br/>
				When I face problems, He comforts me!<br/>
				When I face loss, He provides for me!<br/>
				When I face Death, He carries me Home!<br/>
				He is everything for everybody, everywhere,<br/>
				Every time, and every way.<br/>
				He is God, He is faithful.<br/>
				I am His, and He is mine!<br/>
				My Father in heaven can whip the father of this world.<br/>
				So, if you're wondering why I feel so secure, understand this...<br/>
				He said it and that settles it.<br/>
				God is in control, I am on His side, and<br/>
				That means all is well with my soul.<br/>
