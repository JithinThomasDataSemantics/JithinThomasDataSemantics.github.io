				I dreamed I had an interview with GOD.
				</p>
				<p>
				"So, you would like to interview me?" GOD asked.
				</p>
				<p>
				"If you have time," I said.
				</p>
				<p>
				GOD smile. "My time is eternity... what questions do you have in mind for me?"
				</p>
				<p>
				"What surprises you the most about humankind?"
				</p>
				<p>
				GOD answered...
				</p>
				<p>
				"That they get bored with childhood, that they rush to grow up, and then long to be children again."
				</p>
				<p>
				"That they lose their health to make money... and then lose their money to restore their health."
				</p>
				<p>
				"That by thinking anxiously about the future, they forget the present, such that they live in neither the present nor the future."
				</p>
				<p>
				"That they live as if they would never die, and die as though they had never lived."
				</p>
				<p>
				GOD's hand took mine... and we were silent for a while.
				</p>
				<p>
				And then I asked, "As a parent, what are some of life's lessons you want your children to learn?"
				</p>
				<p>
				GOD replied, "To learn they cannot make anyone love them. All they can do is let themselves be loved."
				</p>
				<p>
				"To learn that it is not good to compare themselves to others."
				</p>
				<p>
				"To learn to forgive by practicing forgiveness."
				</p>
				<p>
				"To learn that it only takes a few seconds to open profound wounds in those they love, and it can take many years to heal them."
				</p>
				<p>
				"To learn that a rich person is not one who has the most, but is one who needs the least."
				</p>
				<p>
				"To learn that there are people who love them dearly, but simply do not yet know how to express or show their feelings."
				</p>
				<p>
				"To learn that two people can look at the same thing, and see it differently."
				</p>
				<p>
				"To learn that it is not enough that they forgive one another, but they must also forgive themselves."
				</p>
				<p>
				"Thank you for your time," I said humbly.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Is there anything else you would like your children to know?"
				</p>
				<p>
				GOD smiled, and said... "Just know that I am here. Always."
