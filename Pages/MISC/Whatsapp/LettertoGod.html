				George worked for the Post Office and his job was to process all the mail that had illegible addresses. One day just before Christmas, a letter landed on his desk simply 
				addressed in shaky handwriting: 'To God'. With no other clue on the envelope, George opened the letter and read:
				</p>
				<p>
				<b><i>"Dear God,</i></b>
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>
				I am an 93 year old widow living on the State pension. Yesterday someone stole my purse. It had Rs:1000 in it, which was all the money I had in the world and no pension due until after 
				Christmas. Next week is Christmas and I had invited two of my friends over for Christmas lunch. Without that money, I have nothing to buy food with. I have no family to turn to, and 
				you are my only hope. God; can you please help me?"
				</i></p>
				<p>
				George was really touched, and being kind hearted, he put a copy of the letter up on the staff notice board at the main Fareham sorting office where he worked. The letter 
				touched the other postmen and they all dug into their pockets and had a whip round. Between them they raised Rs:900 Using an officially franked Post Office envelope, they 
				sent the cash on to the old lady, and for the rest of the day, all the workers felt a warm glow thinking of the nice thing they had done.
				</p>
				<p>
				Christmas came and went. A few days later, another letter simply addressed to 'God' landed in the Sorting Office. Many of the postmen gathered around while George opened the letter. 
				It read,
				</p>
				<p>
				<b><i>"Dear God,</i></b>
				</p>
				<p><i>
				How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your generosity, I was able to provide a lovely luncheon for my friends. We had a very nice day, and I told my 
				friends of your wonderful gift â€“ in fact we haven't gotten over it and even Father John, our parish priest, is beside himself with joy. By the way, there was Rs:100 missing. I 
				think it must have been those thieving fellows at the Post Office."
