				Mr. Harold Hill, President of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore, Maryland and a consultant in the Space Program relates the following development. "I think one of the most amazing 
				things that God has for us today happened recently to our astronauts and space scientists at Greenbelt, Maryland.
				</p>
				<p>
				They were checking the position of the sun, moon, and planets out in space where they would be 100 years and 1000 years from now. We have to know this so we won't send a satellite up 
				and have it bump into something later on in its orbits. We have to lay out the orbits in terms of the life of the satellite, and where the planets will be so the whole thing will not 
				bog down.
				</p>
				<p>
				They ran the computer measurement back and forth over the centuries and it came to a halt. The computer stopped and put up a red signal, which meant that there was something wrong 
				either with the information fed into it or with the results as compared to the standards. They called in the service department to check it out and they asked, "What's wrong?"
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, they found there is a day missing in space in elapsed time. They scratched their heads and tore their hair. There was no answer.
				</p>
				<p>
				Finally, a Christian man on the team said, "You know, one time I was in Sunday School and they talked about the sun standing still." While they didn't believe him, they didn't have an 
				answer either, so they said, "Show us."
				</p>
				<p>
				He got a Bible and went back to the book of Joshua where they found a pretty ridiculous statement for anyone with common sense. There they found the Lord saying to Joshua, "Fear them 
				not, I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee." Joshua was concerned because he was surrounded by the enemy and if darkness fell they would 
				overpower them. So, Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still!
				</p>
				<p>
				That's right, "The sun stood still and the moon stayed - and hasted not to go down about a whole day!" (Joshua 10:12-13)
				</p>
				<p>
				The astronauts and scientists said, "There is the missing day!" They checked the computers going back into the time it was written and found it was close but not close enough. The 
				elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua's day was 23 hours and 20 minutes - not a whole day.
				</p>
				<p>
				They read the Bible and there it was "about (approximately) a day." These little words in the Bible are important, but they were still in trouble because, if you cannot account for 40 
				minutes, you'll still be in trouble 1,000 years from now. Forty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits.
				</p>
				<p>
				As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible where it said the sun went BACKWARDS.
				</p>
				<p>
				The scientists told him he was ! out of his mind, but they got out the Book and read these words in 2 Kings that told of the following story:
				</p>
				<p>
				Hezekiah, on his deathbed, was visited by the prophet Isaiah who told him that he was not going to die. Hezekiah asked for a sign as proof. Isaiah said, "Do you want the sun to go 
				ahead ten degrees?" Hezekiah said "It is nothing for the sun to go ahead ten degrees, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees." Isaiah spoke to the Lord and the Lord brought 
				the shadow ten degrees BACKWARD! Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes!
				</p>
				<p>
				Twenty-three hours and 20 minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in Second Kings make the missing day in the universe!"
