				A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he 
				told him that was all he wanted.
				</p>
				<p>
				As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his private 
				study. His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift box. Curious, but somewhat 
				disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Bible, with the young man's name embossed in gold. Angrily, he raised his voice to his father and said, 
				"With all your money you give me a Bible?" He then stormed out of the house, leaving the Bible.
				</p>
				<p>
				Many years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family, but realizing his father was very old, he thought perhaps he 
				should go to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Before he could make the arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away, and willed 
				all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
				</p>
				<p>
				When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father's important papers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had 
				left it years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, 
				the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words... "PAID IN FULL".

				How many times do we miss blessings because they are not packaged as we expected?
