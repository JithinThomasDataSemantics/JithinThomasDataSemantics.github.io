				Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protector against the wickedness and snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O prince of the 
				heavenly host, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the other evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. AMEN.

				St. Michael the Archangel is a special patron and defender of the Church and its people against Satan. In fact, Pope Francis has consecrated Vatican City to St. Michael's special care.
				</p>

				In 1886, Pope Leo XIII wrote a Prayer to St. Michael to be recited after every Low Mass in every Catholic church throughout the world. The official obligation to recite the prayer was 
				removed in 1964 but it still could be prayed privately or publicly. In 1994, Pope John Paul II recommended its use, saying: "I ask everyone not to forget it and recite it to obtain help 
				in the battle against the forces of darkness and against the spirit of this world."
				</p>
				<p>
				It has again become the practice in some parishes to recite the St. Michael Prayer following Mass.
