				<i>Story from an autobiaography,</i>
				</p>
				<p>
				During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one:
				</p>
				<p>
				"What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?"<br/>
				Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50's, but how would I know her name?
				</p>
				<p>
				I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Absolutely, " said the professor. "In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say "hello."
				</p>
				<p>
				I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.
				</p>
				<p><br/>
				The Bible tells us that all are equal in the eyes of God. We are sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. We may be sinners but the Lord loves us. Every person is important 
				irrespective of his/her color, cast, creed, job, nationality and so on.
