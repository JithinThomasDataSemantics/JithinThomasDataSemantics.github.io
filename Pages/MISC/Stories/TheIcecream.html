				In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop andsat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.
				</p>
				<p>
				"How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked. "Fifteen Rupees," replied the waitress.
				</p>
				<p>
				The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired.
				</p>
				<p>
				By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Ten Rupees," she brusquely replied. The little boy again counted his coins.
				</p>
				<p>
				"I'll have the plain ice cream," he said. The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When 
				the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were five one rupee coins.
				</p>
				<p>
				You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.
				</p>

				We often forget people around us, those who help us or serve us. Somtimes, it just costs us a smile or a polite word to bring happiness into another person's life. Always remember those 
				who serve us at restaurants, the cashiers at grocery stores, the newpaper boy and so on. A "ThankYou" or a Smile can change our lives.
