				Imagine you are at an Airport. While you're waiting for your flight, you notice a kiosk selling cookies. You buy a box, put them in your traveling bag and then you patiently search for 
				an available seat so you can sit down and enjoy your cookies. Finally, you find a seat next to a gentleman.
				</p>
				<p>
				You reach down into your traveling bag and pull out your box of cookies.As you do so, you notice that the gentleman starts watching you intensely. He stares as you open the box and his 
				eyes follow your hand as you pick up the cookie and bring it to your mouth. Just then he reaches over and takes one of your cookies from the box, and eats it! You're more than a little 
				surprised at this. Actually, you 're at a loss for words. Not only does he take one cookie, but also he alternates with you. For every one cookie you take, he takes one.
				</p>
				<p>
				Now, what's your immediate impression of this guy? Crazy? Greedy? He's got some nerve? Can you imagine the words you might use to describe this man to your associates back at the 
				office? Meanwhile, you both continue eating the cookies until there's just one left. To your surprise, the man reaches
				over and takes it. But then he does something unexpected. He breaks it in half, and gives half to you. After he's finished with his half he gets up, and without a word, he leaves.
				</p>
				<p>
				You think to yourself, "Did this really happen?" You're left sitting there dumbfounded and still hungry. So you go back to the kiosk and buy another box of cookies. You then return to 
				your seat and begin opening your new box of cookies when you glance down into your traveling bag.
				</p>
				<p>
				Sitting there in your bag is your original box of cookies â€“ still unopened. Only then do you realize that when you reached for your own cookies earlier, you had reached into the other 
				man's bag, and grabbed his box of cookies by mistake. Now what do you think of that man? Generous? Tolerant?

				<i><p>You've just experienced a profound paradigm shift. You're seeing things from a new point of view. Is it time to change your point of view?
				</p>
				<p>
				Many a times, we are clouded by our own instincts and predispositions. These hamper our relationship with our peers, subordinates and superiors.It helps to be non-judgmental and look 
				beyond the obvious.
