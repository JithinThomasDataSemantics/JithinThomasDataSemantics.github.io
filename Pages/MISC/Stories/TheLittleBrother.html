				Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare & serious disease. Her only chance of recovery appeared 
				to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained 
				the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister.
				</p>
				<p>
				I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, "Yes I'll do it if it will save her." As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and 
				smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheek. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, "Will I start 
				to die right away".
				</p>
				<p>
				Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.
				</p>
				<p><br/>
				Giving When it Counts is what matters. Extending a helping hand to a person in need truly matters.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Work like you don't need the money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like you do when nobody's watching."
				</p>
				<p>
				Don't we think twice or thrice before doing a favor for a friend or even our own parents or siblings? We are often selfish and self centric and choose to do things only if they are 
				beneficial to us. Small things matter a lot. Taking care of our parents, helping our friends or siblings when they have a financial need, giving moral support to a friend who had a bad 
				day â€“ these are the least we can do for others. Jesus Christ gave his life for mankind. He didn't have to think twice about sacrificing his life for saving Mankind.
