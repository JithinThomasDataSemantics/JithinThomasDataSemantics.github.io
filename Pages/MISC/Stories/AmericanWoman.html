				One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she 
				desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960's. The man took 
				her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxicab.
				</p>
				<p>
				She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was 
				delivered to his home. A special note was attached. It read:
				</p>
				<p>
				"Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make 
				it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away... God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others.
				</p>
				<p>
				Sincerely,<br/>
				Mrs Nat King Cole."
				</p>
				<p>
				NB:Nat King Cole, was an American singer who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist.
				</p>
				<p><br/>
				We are so involved in our lives that we often forget to help others. We become selfish and uncaring and are too busy to extend a helping hand.
