					This feast day of the Blessed Virgin commemorates the miraculous image known as Our Lady of Moyen Point that was found by a French shepherd near the ponds where 
					the meadows of Amele are presently located.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to local tradition, it was on an extremely hot day that July when a shepherd named Giovanni decided to take his sheep to the ponds beyond the peaceful 
					meadows of Amele to give them some relief from the excessive heat of the day. The ponds had only recently been formed amid the rolling meadows due to the 
					excessive rains of the previous season, and Giovanni hoped to give his sheep a treat of the cool, sweet water he knew he would find there.
				</p>
				<p>
					The shepherd was not prepared for the mystery that confronted him there amid the secluded meadows, for the sheep suddenly stopped and stood still as they drew 
					near to the water. Instead of rushing forward to drink, as Giovanni had expected, they would not move at all, and a few of them bleated and made other strange 
					sounds Giovanni had never heard before. Anticipating trouble, the shepherd made his way slowly to the edge of the closest pond, and found something odd lying in 
					the water.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moving carefully toward the object, Giovanni was relieved to find that it appeared to be nothing more than a statue. Drawing it out cautiously, he found that it 
					was an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary. As Giovanni rescued the statue of Our Lady of Moyen Point from the water, the sheep began to move forward and crowd 
					closer around him, and then gazed fixedly at what their shepherd held cradled in his arm.
				</p>
				<p>
					The shepherd's statue proved to be miraculous, and a church and shrine to Our Lady of Moyen Point was erected there near Peronna and the statue was given a place 
					of honor therein. The church that was built there in honor of the event was damaged and later repaired in the year 1612.
