				<p>
					This date on the Marian calendar, Our Lady of Spire, actually refers to the Cathedral of Speyer, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and known as Kaiserdom zu Speyer in Germany. 
					Construction began on the Romanesque style cathedral in the year 1030 and was completed in 1106. It is 146 yards long and 47 yards wide, which made it one of the largest buildings 
					constructed at that time in the Middle Ages.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the Nine Years' War the entire town of Speyer was burned to the ground, and the heat from the inferno caused part of the nave to collapse. In 1792 the town was occupied by the 
					French revolutionary troops, and the church pillaged. It was in that century that the ruins of the chapel of Saint Bernard were removed. The cathedral was subsequently used as a 
					warehouse and hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1957 the cathedral was restored, and although much of the plaster and 19th century paintings were removed, the scenes of the life of the Blessed Virgin were left undisturbed. At this 
					time the cathedral is still undergoing restorations that are scheduled to be completed in 2015. In 1981 the cathedral was added to the World Heritage List of UNESCO.
