					Art has been very fond of St. Joachim and St. Ann, the parents of Our Lady. It sensed the deep affection of that religious family. Joachim and Ann took good care of their Heaven-sent 
					child. It was but a fair return that She take care if them, already old when She was born. It is no stretch of imagination for us to see Mary waiting hand and foot on the old couple, 
					sitting by their sick-bed and folding their hands in death.
				</p>

					More so with St. Joseph. Theirs was a virgin marriage, but as it is souls that love, not bodies, their mutual love was the greatest love-match the world has ever seen. St. Joseph is the 
					Patron of the Dying because Jesus and Mary sat by his sick-bed, his death-bed. Mary wet his parched lips, smoothed his pillow, kept vigil through the night, folded his hands, and closed 
					his eyes. One likes to think that it is in memory of that, that She is first called "Health of the Sick," that Her love followed Joseph to the grave and after.

					But it was as Mother -  Mother of God - that Mary was consecrated "Health of the Sick." Jesus was immune to sickness and death, but He willed that He be struck as a leper, and He died. Who 
					will try to estimate the source of strength Mary was to Him in His dereliction, in His scourging, His crowning with thorns, His way of the Cross, and finally in the three-hour passion 
					and death? Every line of the Stabat Mater is a commentary on Her title - "Health of the Sick," with its final prayer for a happy death, applying to us: "Christ when Thou shalt call me 
					hence, be Thy Mother my defense; be Thy Cross my victory. While my body here decays, may my soul Thy goodness praise, safe in Paradise with Thee." And "Health of the Sick" (Salus 
					Infirmorum) primarily means our eternal health, our eternal salvation - for salus means not only "health," but "salvation."

					That Mary should have a special love for the sick was necessary if She was to follow the example of Jesus. He was the Divine Physician for bodies as well as souls. To narrate the many 
					cures of the sick by Him and His Disciples would be to quote most of the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. He had come to destroy sin; He had sympathy for the sickness which man had 
					brought upon himself by original sin. The healing of the sick man was not only a proof of His Divine Mission, a proof that He was Lord of Life and Death, and therefore God, but also a 
					work of pure Mercy, the compulsion of His love. His love for the sick was so great that He instituted the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, one of the purposes of which is to restore the 
					body to health, if it is to the spiritual benefit of the patient.

					While on earth, Our Lady was ever kind to the sick. She has not ceased to help them now that She is in Heaven. The lives of the Saints are filled with manifestations of Her power over 
					sickness. We have but to remember the case of the Little Flower. When she was a little girl she was given up for dead, but the statue of the Blessed Virgin smiled upon her and she was 
					instantly restored to health, in order to work out her life of extraordinary sanctity. In that instance Mary was, as St. Ephrem calls Her - "the joy of the sick." The restoration of 
					health to the little Thérèse was not only for the welfare of her soul but for the greater glory of God. That cannot always be said. Many a sickness is a true blessing from God. St. 
					Thomas More, when he was in prison waiting for death, wrote a book - "The Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation." It is one of the loveliest spiritual books ever written. One thought of 
					his is this: "How many men attain health of body, that were better for their souls' health their bodies were sick still." Mary does not make such mistakes. She is concerned with what is 
					effective for the soul's salvation.

					Health of body, yes; Mary wants us to have that, as Her Divine Son gave health of body. But most of all, She wants for us health of soul. Salus means salvation. And She who cooperated 
					in the Redemption wants to see us healed of the disease of soul. Father Damien became a martyr to disease for love of God and love of souls. The world honors his memory because he saved 
					bodies and eased their torments. More than all he gave his life for souls. But what was Father Damien in his zeal for souls compared with Our Lady? There is an old Irish prayer that 
					runs - "O Lady, Physician of the most miserable diseases, behold the many ulcers of my soul." So St. Simon Stock called Her - "Medicine of sinners," as St. Ephrem called Her "Robust health 
					for those who have recourse to Her." Thus the Church applies to Her the words of Proverbs - (8: 3, 5) "He that shall find Me shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord."

					Mary is called the Cedar of Lebanon. It is interesting to note that healing virtues were attributed to this tree. St. Bernard has among his beautiful tributes to Her, this one: "O 
					Mother of God, Thou dost not disdain a sinner, however loathsome he may be: if he send up his sighs to Thee, Thou wilt deliver him with Thine own hand from despair." We can learn from 
					Our Lady"s love for the sick.
