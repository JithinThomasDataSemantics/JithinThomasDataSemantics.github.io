					In the East Indies stands the church and the shrine of Our Lady of Cranganor, which it is asserted, was built by one of the three Kings who visited the Divine 
					Child and His Blessed Mother. India was one of the countries that had the privilege of receiving the light of Faith at the dawn of Christianity.

					History relates that Saint Thomas the Apostle came to India at Cranganor in 52 AD. There the Christians are still known as Saint Thomas Faithful. Kerala, as the 
					place is also known, is cut off by the mountain ranges from the rest of India, and has held firmly to the Faith, regardless of the gloom of the rest of the 
					continent. The deep spirituality of the Catholics evidences their great love for the Mother of God, Our Lady of Cranganor. Nala-bat as the country is likewise 
					called, may be translated as Mary's country, Mary's namesake. It is believed that when Saint Thomas came to Cranganor, he brought with him a picture of Our Lady, 
					painted by Saint Luke; this was lost after Saint Thomas' martyrdom, but later discovered in a cave at Little Mount, Madras, near the scene of his death.

					In 1498 when the Portuguese arrived in Cranganor, they were surprised to find so many churches dedicated to Mary. Saint Francis Xavier found the people of 
					Cranganor very strong in faith and devoted to Mary, Our Lady of Cranganor; he spared no pains to flame their devotion to the Mother of God.

					One may wonder why devotion to Mary took root and blossomed so strongly in Kerala  -  almost as though it met some deep religious and psychological need. Perhaps 
					the reason for such spontaneous devotion is to be found in the position of the mother in the Hindu family. For while love, obedience, devotion and dependence on 
					one's mother are natural to all peoples and nations, in Cranganor the exalted position of the mother assumes singular, if not unique, proportions. The mother is 
					everything in the family; to depend on her is a deep-rooted tendency of all children in Kerala. Much more than the father, the mother is the bread-winner in the 
					family. She owns, buys, and sells property and governs the house without any consultation with the father; he may frequently be away, but she always remains at 
					home in the house. Her brothers have no right to property, only a living allowance and accommodations. Now this matriarchal system has been carefully guarded by 
					the majority of Hindus. It lies at the very heart of the traditional way of life in Kerala; a time-honored custom which has helped to give Marian devotion an 
					easy welcome and speedy growth.

					Saint Ignatius of Loyola always wore the rosary conspicuously over his cassock. To his great satisfaction, Our Lady's "Madre de Dios" church was assigned to him 
					on his arrival at Cochin, replacing Cranganor as the port of traffic with the western world. When Saint Francis arrived, he found a Confraternity of the Blessed 
					Virgin Mary already established and he fostered this zealously during his lifetime.
