					 This title was rather rarely used in the past, but has recently become more common in the pronouncements of the Church's Magisterium and in the devotion of the Christian people. The 
					faithful first called upon Mary with the title "Mother of God". "Mother of the faithful" or "our Mother", to emphasize her personal relationship with each of her children.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later, because of the greater attention paid to the mystery of the Church and to Mary's relationship to her, the Blessed Virgin began more frequently to be invoked as "Mother of the 
					Church". Before the Second Vatican Council, this expression was found in Pope Leo XIII's Magisterium, in which it is affirmed that Mary is "in all truth mother of the Church" . 
					The title was later used many times in the teachings of John XXIII and Paul VI.
				</p>
				<p>
					 Although the title "Mother of the Church" was only recently attributed to Mary, it expresses the Blessed Virgin's maternal relationship with the Church as shown already in several 
					New Testament texts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the Annunciation, Mary was called, to give her consent to the coming of the messianic kingdom, which would take place with the formation of the Church.
				</p>
				<p>
					When at Cana Mary asked the Son to exercise his messianic power, she made a fundamental contribution to implanting the faith in the first community of disciples, and she co-operated in 
					initiating God's kingdom, which has its "seed" and "beginning" in the Church .
				</p>
				<p>
					On Calvary, Mary united herself to the sacrifice of her Son and made her own maternal contribution to the work of salvation, which took the form of labour pains, the birth of the new 
					humanity.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addressing the words "Woman, behold your son" to Mary, the Crucified One proclaims her motherhood not only in relation to the Apostle John but also to every disciple. The Evangelist 
					himself, by saying that Jesus had to die "to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad" (Jn 11:52), indicates the Church's birth as the fruit of the redemptive 
					sacrifice with which Mary is maternally associated.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Evangelist St Luke mentions the presence of Jesus' Mother in the first community of Jerusalem (Acts 1:14). In this way he stresses Mary's maternal role in the newborn Church, 
					comparing it to her role in the Redeemer's birth. The maternal dimension thus becomes a fundamental element of Mary's relationship with the new People of the redeemed.
				</p>
				<p>

					The title "Mother of the Church" thus reflects the deep conviction of the Christian faithful, who see in Mary not only the mother of the person of Christ, but also of the faithful. 
					She who is recognized as mother of salvation, life and grace, mother of the saved and mother of the living, is rightly proclaimed Mother of the Church.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pope Paul VI would have liked the Second Vatican Council itself to have proclaimed "Mary Mother of the Church, that is, of the whole People of God, of the faithful and their Pastors". 
					He did so himself in his speech at the end of the Council's third session , also asking that "henceforth the Blessed Virgin be honoured and invoked with this title by 
					all the Christian people".
				</p>
				<p>
					In this way, my venerable Predecessor explicitly enunciated the doctrine contained in chapter eight of Lumen gentium, hoping that the title of Mary, Mother of the Church, would have an 
					ever more important place in the liturgy and piety of the Christian people.
