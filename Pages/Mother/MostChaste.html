					"With me is strength, by me kings reign." Mary alone, of all human beings, after her Divine Son, was born free from the least stain of original sin. From this 
					fact flow many consequences which are of importance for us to consider.
				</p>
				<p>
					 Mary was free from the least disorderly movement of nature, from the slightest surprise of passion or weakness, from every rebellion of the flesh against the 
					spirit. Of her it could never be said that "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Every part of her nature, her body, her soul, her spirit, was in 
					perfect harmony, perfectly balanced. All her actions, thoughts, words, movements were perfectly under the control of reason, and her reason was completely 
					subject to God.
				</p>
				<p>
					In other words, she possessed the four cardinal virtues, prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance, in their perfection. It was not that she had not to work 
					for her virtues. She revealed to a saintly nun by the name of Elizabeth, that she had acquired no virtue without effort and continual prayer. True, she had not 
					that continual struggle to overcome evil tendencies born in her, that we have. Yet she was more vigilant in watching over herself, in denying herself, and in 
					praying for grace than any human being ever has been.
				</p>
				<p>
					 All this harmonious perfection, this moderation, this self-control was in her the effect of the virtue of temperance, which means balance, restraint, moderation 
					in all, especially bodily pleasures, eating, drinking, and all the enjoyments of the senses. Drunkenness, gluttony, and excessive love of pleasure are sins 
					against the virtue of temperance. By nature we all love pleasure so passionately that we have need of continual watchfulness lest this love of pleasure lead us 
					to do things forbidden by God.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pleasure is not a sin; far from it. The abuse arises from loving pleasure so much that, in order to obtain it, we do not hesitate to commit sin. We must be able 
					to draw back, to say "No" to ourselves, when reason tells us that we are going too far. What would happen, for instance, if a small child were allowed to eat and 
					drink everything that pleased its taste? It would certainly kill itself before long. It has to be trained, and refused what is bad for it, and not allowed to eat 
					too much even of what is good for it. It is much the same with our passions.
				</p>
				<p>
					If Adam had not sinned, we should not have had any trouble in ruling our passions, and the senses, which are now so rebellious. Does it not often happen that we 
					excuse a fault by saying: "Oh! I really could not help it!" We seemed to do the thing almost before we knew it was wrong. We were not sufficiently trained in 
					self-control. It was not so with Our Blessed Lady. She, being conceived without sin, and with the gift of original justice, all her acts, as we have said, were 
					under the control of reason; she could never be surprised into any sin, into anger, lying, sloth, greediness, or anything wrong, as we so often are. Yet she was 
					always most guarded, most selfcontrolled, most mortified. The Saints tell us that she fasted continually. All this, and much more, is implied in the title, 
					"Mother Most Chaste."
				</p>
				<p>
					It would be impossible to learn this great lesson of selfcontrol all at once. It is as if we had to take some terribly strong or violent dose of medicine, which 
					would cause us great suffering if taken all at once, but instead is taken in small quantities. In the same way we should accustom ourselves to self-restraint in 
					small doses, being on our guard when we find a thing very pleasant to nature, so as not to let it enslave us, not allowing our senses everything they crave for, 
					cheerfully enduring small inconveniences, and so on, that we may gradually obtain a habit of self-control. It is only thus that we can hope to obtain the virtue 
					of temperance in its widest sense, and become like to Our Mother Most Chaste. In this, as in all else, we must look to her, not only for example, but also for 
					help, in the fight to subdue our lower nature.
