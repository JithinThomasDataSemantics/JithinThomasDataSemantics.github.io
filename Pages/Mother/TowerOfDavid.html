					Towers are for two purposes, either strength and defense, or for beauty and ornament. In the next two titles of Our Lady's Litany, towers are considered under these two aspects - and 
					first in the primitive sense of the word, as a stronghold of defense and security in war. To address Our Lady as "Tower of David" really means, "Our Lady of Soldiers" or "Our Lady of 
					Victories." This title is no doubt inspired by that text of the Canticle of Canticles: "Thy neck is as the tower of David; a thousand bucklers (small round shields) hang upon it, all 
					the armor of valiant men. We do not need to be told what a great war it is, in which we need the defense of this strong tower, the Mother of God. It is the great battle between God and 
					the Devil, between good and evil. This war concerns every one of us; whether we like it or not, we have all got to take part in it, to take sides, to fight, one way or the other. There 
					is no such thing as remaining passive and neutral. Our Lord has said: "He that is not with Me, is against Me." What a terrible thing! To be against God! And this we shall be if we are 
					indifferent in this great war.

					Which side are you on? You may smile at the question, and reply that, of course, you are on the side of God. But are you a true and valiant soldier? Have you fought this day, are you 
					fighting this hour, this minute? You know the three enemies that we Christians have to fight against all the days of our life - the Devil, the world, and the flesh. Are you really, 
					consciously, actively struggling against these three enemies? Sometimes it seems a weary, hopeless, endless business. Do you not occasionally feel like throwing down your weapons and 
					saying: "Oh, I can't be good; it's no use trying! I will give up!" It seems so dull, so boring to be good. You want to have "a good time," you say, like others do - to live, to get some 
					enjoyment out of life. Well, you are not shut out from joy by being good - far from it. But no doubt one sometimes has to sacrifice pleasure and fun to duty, play to work.

					Where are you going to get allies to join you in your fight against these rebellious feelings? We have the answer in this title, "Tower of David." In the Office of the Feast of the Most 
					Holy Rosary there is the antiphon, Virgo potens, sicut Turris David, mille clypei pendent ex ea, omnis armatura fortium. It is the mighty Virgin, like the Tower of David; a thousand 
					bucklers hang upon it, all the armor of valiant men. Here Mary is compared to a strong fortress, full of weapons, to which you can always fly for refuge in the fray, and where you will 
					find fresh armor and strong weapons for the fight. This was what the Tower of David was - a fortress where weapons were kept. Our Lady likes us to fight bravely; She looks on approvingly 
					and says: "Well done, good and faithful soldier." She is Our Lady of Victories, and without a fight there is no victory. Let us be brave in heart, and when beginning to get the worst of 
					it, let us call upon Mary, the Tower of David. Oh, how willing we shall find Her to help us! Let us then remember, when life is hard, when things go wrong, when we have to bear failure 
					and disappointment, and are cross and depressed, weary and hopeless, or inclined to let things slide and yield to our own selfish inclinations, when we have unpleasant work to do, or 
					hard duties to perform, to overcome our temper, or sloth, or selfishness, or feelings of rebellion, let us call upon Mary, the Tower of David, and remember that in Her we shall ever 
					find "all the armor of valiant men." Tower of David, pray for us. She is an ally who can never fail us. She will never desert us, or turn a deaf ear to our call for help. St. Paul said: 
					"I can do all things in Him who strengtheneth me;" so may we, children of Mary, say of our Mother, the Tower of David, "In Mary I can do all things."
