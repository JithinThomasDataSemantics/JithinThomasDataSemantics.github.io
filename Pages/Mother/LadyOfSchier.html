					Arnaud Schier is remembered as being the odd son of the Bavarian House of Schier. Sullen and disgruntled, he angrily left the dining hall before the meal was finished. It would prove to 
					be his last meal. His parents had decided to give up their castle, which Arnaud had hoped would be his heritage, for the honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He did not favor the idea of 
					giving the castle to the Virgin, and no one had even thought to ask him his opinion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Slamming the door, he wandered into the darkness of night alone, caring little if anyone should overhear his repeated objections. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. 
					Why did the family wish to give up the ancestral home? And for a shrine to Our Lady at that! Arnaud wanted no more of this continued discussion on the subject. On he walked, oblivious 
					of where, nursing his grievance against the Mother of God. He was last seen by a servant waiving his hands in the air and bemoaning his loss, wondering what he should do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Arnaud had forgotten that his chief concern should have been to seek after perfection. Children will usually imitate their parents after initially watching them and then conversing with 
					them. Parents who are a fine Christian example, such as Arnaud's parents, should have had children who would also seek to imitate their Divine Master. The surest route is with the help 
					of God's grace, but also through the intercession of His Most Holy Mother.
