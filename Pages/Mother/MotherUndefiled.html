					The revolt of our first parents against the law of God marked for them the beginning of a painful and humiliating conflict of sense against reason, of the flesh 
					against the spirit. This conflict from which no son of Adam is free, requires, on the part of the soul, continual vigilance and generous endeavors to avoid sin: 
					"For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh." (Gal. v, 17.)
				</p>

					The concupiscence within us is the cause of numberless venial sins. It may even become, if we do not combat it, the source of deadly falls. Our lot, then, is 
					indeed most pitiable, and St. Paul had reason to exclaim: "Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"  (Rom. vii, 24.) But thanks 
					be to God, who has procured for our weakness an unfailing support, for which we must be eternally grateful to Him: this is divine grace, by which we can avoid 
					every mortal fault, and moreover keep ourselves free from venial transgressions, if not for the whole course of our life, at least for lengthy periods. This 
					grace is even so fruitful, that besides the strength it gives us to resist concupiscence, it also furnishes us with a potent means for increasing merit. "God," 
					says St. Paul, "will make also with temptation issue." (l Cor. x, 13.)

					Mary, having contracted no stain of original sin, was thereby free from that concupiscence which is its fruit, and which consists in the rebellion of the 
					inferior part of the soul against the superior. She therefore felt in herself no inclination, except for what was comformable to reason and grace. Consequently, 
					she never committed the slightest venial sin, which consists in the rebellion of our unruled passions against the law of reason. Further, by an altogether 
					special privilege, Mary's will was so assisted by the Holy Spirit, that it was never alienated from God by mortal sin. It is therefore the privilege of our Queen 
					to have been exempted from all stain of sin, even the slightest, during the whole course of her mortal career.

					Oh, how Jesus delighted in the soul of His Holy Mother! What unutterable sweetness He experienced in her! With what transports of love He would say to her: 
					"Behold thou art fair, O my love, behold thou art fair." (Cant, i, 14.) "Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee." (Cant, iv, 7.) "Thou art 
					beautiful, O my love, sweet and comely." (Cant,vi, 8)
				</p>
				<p>	
					Be thou praised and thanked, O Lord, for having given to Thy Son Jesus Christ, a Mother so pure and holy, whose converse was for Him a never-failing source of 
					consolation in the sorrows and pains of His mortal life, and an ample compensation for man's ingratitude.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Mary's sinlessness during her mortal life differs from the impeccability of the saints in heaven. These, by reason of the vision of the Divine Essence, which 
					they behold face to face, are incapable of sin: whilst Mary, who was not in possession of the beatific vision, absolutely speaking, might have fallen from divine 
					grace. But she had this advantage over the Blessed in heaven, that her sinlessness did not prevent her from acquiring merits, whilst the saints in heaven can no 
					longer do so.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Indeed, though Mary did not feel, as we do, the temptations of the flesh, nor experience the difficulties which we encounter in performing acts of virtue, 
					nevertheless, her merits went on continually increasing to an inconceivable extent during her whole mortal life. Merit is increased in proportion to the ardor of 
					the will, and Mary's will was ever prompt to execute the commands of God, howsoever difficult they might be. The Holy Mother of God being without shadow of sin, 
					and being in all her actions prompted by the most fervent charity, was able, as theology teaches, to merit for man de oongruo all that Jesus Christ, by His 
					passion and death, merited for us de condigno.
