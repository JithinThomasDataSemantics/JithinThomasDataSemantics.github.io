				Hainault is a province in Wallonia in Belgium that borders on France, West and East Flanders, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant, and the name comes from the Haine River which flows 
				through the province. The Hainault family was very prominent in the Middle Ages, and Baldwin VI led the 4th Crusade. As of this time I can find no current reference to Our Lady of Haut, 
				or a shrine to the Blessed Mother of that name in Hainault.

				"Referring to Our Lady's great compassion for sinners, Saint Bernard calls her the Promised Land flowing with milk and honey. And Saint Leo tells us that, when he looks at her, he no 
				longer sees God's justice but only His mercy, for Mary is full of the mercy of God.
				</p>
				<p>
				"She is like a fair olive in the field (Sir 24:14). Only oil (a symbol of mercy) is extracted from the olive; only grace and mercy flow from the hands of Mary.
				</p>
				<p>
				"Why is the fair olive tree pictured as standing in the field, and not in some garden, enclosed with walls or hedges? So that all can see her plainly, and get to her without trouble, to 
				secure the remedy for all their evils.
				</p>
				<p>
				"And what safer refuge can we find than the compassionate heart of Mary? There the poor find a home, the sick a cure, the afflicted consolation, the doubtful counsel, and the abandoned 
				help."
