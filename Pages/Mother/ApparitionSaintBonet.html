					Saint Bonitus, or Saint Bonet, was for ten years the Bishop of Clermont in Auvergne. He was known to be greatly devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary. According to tradition, he actually 
					saw the Blessed Virgin Mary while he was praying by himself in church. On that day he was interrupted from his prayers when he heard angelic voices singing in heavenly harmonies. He 
					lifted his head to see a multitude of angels entering the church, their light filling the entire place. With them were many of the saints, who processed along behind the angels. They 
					were followed by the Queen of Heaven, who was seated upon a magnificent throne that was held aloft by the seraphim.
				</p>

					When the heavenly procession stopped before the main altar, Saint Bonitus hear some of the saints ask who was to say Mass. The Blessed Virgin herself turn to Saint Bonitus and said:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Here is Bonitus, my faithful servant and excellent bishop. He is worthy of fulfilling this holy function."
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the blessed saints then detached themselves from the others and approached the holy bishop, who was startled and trembling as they raised him to his feet. Taking him by the 
					hand, they accompanied the bishop to the choir where they clothed him in a chasuble of marvelous workmanship that the Blessed Virgin had brought for him to say this Mass. The saints and 
					angels assisted the bishop as acolytes.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the Mass was ended the Blessed Virgin, the saints and angels left the bishop alone again. Two years later Saint Bonitus retired and went to the abbey of Manlieu, where he remained 
					until he died in the year 710. The chasuble that was the gift of the Blessed Virgin was kept at Clermont until the year 1793, when it was burned with many other sacred relics by the 
					broad minded insurrectionists of the French Revolution.
