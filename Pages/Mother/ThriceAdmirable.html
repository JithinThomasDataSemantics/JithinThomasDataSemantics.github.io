					In 1914-1915, the sodalists made their first attempts were made to find an appropriate picture of the Virgin Mary for the chapel. One of the teachers at the 
					college gave them a lithograph copy of a painting by the Italian painter, Luigi Crosio. In the beginning, the boys did not really like the picture and some said 
					that it would need several changes from an aesthetic point of view. Since they did not have money to buy another picture, they placed this picture in the Shrine 
					over Easter 1915. This picture has always remained in the Shrine since then.

					The picture originally had the name, 'Refugium peccatorum'  -  Refuge of Sinners. The young Schoenstatt group soon found a title that held greater meaning for them 
					because of their own history: Mater Ter Admirabilis  -  Mother Thrice Admirable. Midway through 1916, this title was used to honour the picture of the Blessed 
					Mother in the Schoenstatt Shrine. 'MTA' (as she is often called in Schoenstatt) is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase 'Mater Ter Admirabilis.' Its literal 
					meaning is 'greatly admirable mother.' More recently, however, this title for Our Lady has taken on more symbolic meanings. For example, she is called Thrice 
					Admirable because she is the Mother of God, the Mother of the Saviour and Mother of the redeemed. She can also be described as Thrice Admirable because her 
					faith, her love and her hope.
