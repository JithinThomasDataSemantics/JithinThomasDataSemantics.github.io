					Devotion to the Sorrows of Mary has always been a favorite devotion among Catholics. It has been sanctioned by the Church and introduced into the Missal and 
					Breviary. In order to keep before our minds the inexpressible sufferings endured for us by the Mother of God while she lived here on earth with her Divine Son, 
					the Church observes two feasts in honor of the Seven Dolors of Mary; one on the Friday before Good Friday and the other on September 15. She has enriched with 
					numerous indulgences the Rosary of the Seven Dolors, as well as a number of other devotions to the Mother of Sorrows. How touching is the beautiful hymn, Stabat 
					Mater Dolorosa, which the Church intertwines with the public recitation of the Way of the Cross. The Church spares no pain to induce her children to venerate the 
					sufferings of their Heavenly Mother. Seven of her sorrows have been chosen for our special veneration. Holy Church recalls to our mind only seven of Our Lady's 
					Dolors, but who could form an estimate of their real number! The sufferings of the Mother of God cannot be comprehended; they are inconceivable. But although her 
					whole life was, like that of her Divine Son, a continuous series of sufferings and tribulations, the greatest woes and trials came to her during the week of the 
					bitter passion and death of Jesus, when the storm of hatred and fury burst forth with all violence against Him. The precise object of the devotion to Our Lady of 
					Sorrows consists of a heartfelt and sincere compassion for the Sorrows which the most holy Virgin endured through her whole life, especially for her long 
					martyrdom, which began with the prophecy of holy Simeon and was consummated on Calvary.

					Devotion to the sorrows of Mary should be practiced especially by souls who wish to rid themselves of sinful habits. This devotion nourishes the spirit of 
					compunction, affords great consolation, strengthens confidence in God's mercy, draws down the special protection of the Blessed Mother in the hour of temptation 
					and preserves the converted sinner from relapsing into sin. The Mother of God once said to her faithful servant St. Bridget: "No matter how numerous a person's 
					sins may be, if he turns to me with a sincere purpose of amendment, I am prepared forthwith to receive him graciously, for I do not regard the number of sins he 
					has committed, but look only upon the dispositions with which he comes to me; for I feel no aversion in healing his wounds, because I am called and am in truth 
					the Mother of Mercy." One of the gifts granted to those who have a devotion to the Dolors of Mary is the grace of a good and holy death. In recompense for her 
					fidelity in remaining near to Jesus as He died on the Cross, Our Lady of Sorrows has received from Him a special power to assist souls in their last agony and no 
					doubt she will above all exercise this power in behalf of those who have wept with her and compassionated her.

					Our Lord once said to Veronica of Binasco: "My daughter, the tears which you shed in compassion for My sufferings are pleasing to Me, but bear in mind that on 
					account of My infinite love for My Mother, the tears you shed in compassion for her sufferings are still more precious."

					Seven Sorrows of Mother Mary
				</em></strong></p>
				</p>
				<p>					
					1. The prophecy of Simeon: "And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted; And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that out of many hearts thoughts may be revealed."  -  Luke II, 34-35.
					<br/>
					2. The flight into Egypt: "And after they (the wise men) were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: Arise and take the child and His mother and fly into Egypt: and be there until I shall tell thee. For it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy Him. Who arose and took the child and His mother by night, and retired into Egypt: and He was there until the death of Herod."  -  Matt. II, 13-14.
					<br/>
					3. The loss of the Child Jesus in the temple: "And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the Child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and His parents knew it not. And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And not finding Him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking Him." Luke II, 43-45.
					<br/>
					4. The meeting of Jesus and Mary on the Way of the Cross: "And there followed Him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented Him."  -  Luke XXIII, 27.
					<br/>
					5. The Crucifixion: "They crucified Him. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, His Mother. When Jesus therefore had seen His Mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, He saith to His Mother: Woman: behold thy son. After that he saith to the disciple: Behold thy Mother."  -  John XIX, l8-25-27.
					<br/>
					6. The taking down of the Body of Jesus from the Cross: "Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counselor, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking Him down, wrapped Him up in the fine linen."  -  Mark XV, 43-46.
					<br/>
					7. The burial of Jesus: "Now there was in the place where He was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein no man yet had been laid. There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulcher was nigh at hand." John XIX, 41-42.

				<p>	
					<em>The Blessed Virgin Mary grants seven graces to the souls who honor her daily by
					saying seven Hail Mary's and meditating on her tears and dolors (sorrows).
					The devotion was passed on by St. Bridget.</em>
				</p>
				<p><strong><em>	
					Seven graces are:
				</em></strong></p>
				</p>
				<p>				
					1. I will grant peace to their families.
					<br/>					
					2. They will be enlightened about the divine mysteries.
					<br/>
					3. I will console them in their pains and I will accompany them in their work.
					<br/>
					4. I will give them as much as they ask for as long as it does not oppose the adorable will of my divine Son or the sanctification of their souls.
					<br/>
					5. I will defend them in their spiritual battles with the infernal enemy and I will protect them at every instant of their lives.
					<br/>
					6. I will visibly help them at the moment of their death, they will see the face of their Mother.
					<br/>
					7. I have obtained from my divine Son, that those who propagate this devotion to my tears and dolors, will be taken directly from this earthly life to eternal happiness since all their sins will be forgiven and my Son and I will be their eternal consolation and joy.
