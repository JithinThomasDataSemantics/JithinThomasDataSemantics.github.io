					Devotion to the Mother of Good Counsel is associated with the story of a miraculous icon. The sacred image is found in a church in Genazzano, a beautiful town 
					thirty miles south-east of Rome. The church dedicated to the Mother of Good Counsel was built there in the fourth century. In 1356 the church was given over to 
					the Augustinians. Restoration started in 1467, when a widow, Petruccia, sold all her belongings to help finance the project. However, funds ran out before the 
					task was completed.
				</p>
				<p>	
					That same year, all the residents of Genazzano heard a beautiful melody coming from heaven. As they looked up, they saw a white, shining cloud that descended on 
					the church of the Mother of Good Counsel. The cloud gradually vanished, revealing a beautiful painting of Our Lady tenderly holding her Divine Son in her arms. 
					Immediately, Mary began to cure the sick and grant countless graces.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The news spread throughout the country. Two Albanians from Scutari  appeared in the town with a curious tale. They had fled from their homeland to escape the 
					invading Turks. Before fleeing, they had stopped in the church and had seen how the icon of Our Lady, wrapped in a white cloud, lifted off the wall on which it 
					had hung for two centuries. They followed the picture until they could see the towers of Rome, when it suddenly disappeared. The mysterious icon of Genezzano was 
					identical to the one in the church in Scutari.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The amazing news reached Rome. Pope Paul II sent two bishops to investigate the story. The prelates reported that 171 miracles were recorded in the months 
					following the icon's appearance. The pope's commission also found that there was an empty space on the church wall at Scutari. An icon that had been venerated 
					there for centuries was, indeed, missing.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The image was painted on a sheet of plaster so thin that it would have been impossible for any human hand to remove it without damage. It had survived the 
					subsequent centuries through the tumult of several earthquakes and withstood the bombing during World War II. Several altars were destroyed, walls caved in, and 
					the roof was crushed. The icon, only yards away from the explosion, remained intact.
				</p>
				<p>	
					In 1753, Pope Benedict XIV established the Pious Union of Our Lady of Good Counsel to promote devotion to Mary under this title. Pope Leo XIII added the title 
					Mother of Good Counsel to the Litany of Loreto. Pope Pius XII dedicated his term of office to Our Lady of Good Counsel. And Pope John XXIII visited her shrine to 
					pray for the success of the Second Vatican Council.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The icon at Genazzano is about a foot wide and eighteen inches high. It depicts a mother figure that is half turned toward her son and half toward the viewer, 
					reflecting Mary's concern for both Jesus and his Church
