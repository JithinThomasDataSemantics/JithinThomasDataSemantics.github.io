				<p>
					The translation "Virgin Most Renowned" does not give the exact sense of the Latin "Virgo Praedicanda," which translates more accurately "Virgin to be Proclaimed or Extolled."
				</p>
				<p>
					To Her applies that word of Sacred Scripture: "They that explain Me shall have life everlasting."
				</p>
				<p>
					But surely we need no prompting to pay Our Blessed Mother this tribute of love. Surely the love of Her which overflows in the hearts of all of us will sometimes find expression in words!
				</p>
				<p>
					We all love to talk about our favorite pursuits. "Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh." If we really love anybody or anything, we shall make them the subject of 
					conversation, at least with intimate friends, who share our sentiments. How much good can be done by words, and how much evil!
				</p>
				<p>
					People generally do not want to listen to sermons, except from those authorized to preach, so it is neither necessary nor desirable for lay persons to "preach." But a simple word spoken 
					unaffectedly, about Our Blessed Mother, may plant the seed of love and trust in Her in a heart, to bear fruit in due season, in a way perhaps never dreamt of. How Mary treasures all 
					such words about Her, and how faithfully She will reward and bless them! Ask Her to give you the occasion and the grace to frequently explain, honor and praise Her in a worthy manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Glorious things are said of Thee, O City of God!" These words may well be applied to Mary. What glorious, burning words have been said by the great Fathers and Doctors of the Church in 
					all ages to celebrate the praises of Mary, to "explain Her!" It would take more than a lifetime to read all the wonderful works that have been written about Her. Think of St. Bernard, 
					St. Bonaventure, St. Anselm, St. Alphonsus, and others of Her devoted preachers, who have made Her glories their special subject. St. Bernard said that there was nothing which delighted 
					him more than to preach sermons on the Mother of God.
				</p>
				<p>
					And even to this day he continues to preach Her, for it is his beautiful and glowing panegyrics, above all other Saints, which are used by the Church in the Offices of the Feasts of Our 
					Blessed Lady, and in the prayers which we say daily, such as the familiar "Memorare."
				</p>
				<p>
					To him She was truly the "Virgo Praedicanda." Let it be the same with us, each in his own humble sphere; we can all add something which is truly our very own, to this mighty torrent of 
					the Virgin's praise. And it will be noticed and loved, for nothing we do in Her honor is ever unnoticed or unrewarded by Her. Each one of us can help to preach Our Blessed Mother by 
					distributing books, medals and pictures of Her. All this preaches Her, makes Her known. Even if people only take them with some vague notion of honoring Her, Our Lady will reward our 
					faith and zeal by giving them graces. Many are the conversions recorded which began in this way.
				</p>
				<p>
					We should also love to read good books about Mary, so as to increase and deepen our knowledge of the greatness, the dignity, the privileges of Our Mother, and so be able to speak of 
					Her, when occasion offers, more worthily. When we read the beautiful and profound things said about her by the great Saints, even if we do not fully enter into their meaning, our notion 
					of Her greatness and dignity is insensibly exalted, and we gradually grow in the true knowledge of Her. We shall never be able to find a more attractive, a more fruitful object of 
					thought or study than Mary.
