					The abbey of Our Lady of Bonport, or Notre-Dame de Bon Port, was founded on March 11th, 1190, by King Richard the Lion Heart, King of England and Duke of 
					Normandy. According to legend, the king was in peril of his life on the river Seine when he made a vow that he would found a monastery on that side if he arrived 
					safely (in French Ã  Bonport) on the opposite bank of the river.
				</p>
				<p>
					The abbey was built shortly afterwards in that place in the north of France in the Haute-Normandy region with the help of many of the local lords. It had been 
					damaged and restored several times throughout its history until its cloister and church were finally destroyed during the French Revolution. Our Lady of Bonport 
					is one of the few remaining Cistercian abbeys in Normandy with monastic buildings from the Middle Ages, including a magnificent 13th century vaulted refectory.

					There is a brief description of some of what could once be found in the church before the devastation of the Revolution. "A fine rose-window in the church of the 
					abbey of Bonport, and two specimens of painted glass from its windows, the one representing angels holding musical instruments, supposed to be of the thirteenth 
					century, the other containing a set of male and female heads of extraordinarily rich color, probably executed about a century later, were given by Willemin in 
					his very beautiful Monumens Francais inedits. In the same work, you will likewise find two still more interesting painted windows Pont-de-l'Arche; some boatmen 
					and their wives in the Norman costume of the end of the sixteenth century, and a citizen of the town with his lady, praying before a fald-stool, bearing the date 
					1621."
