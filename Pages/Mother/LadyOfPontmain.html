					It was in the winter of 1871 in the village of Pontmain, France, Eugene Barbedette was busy in his father's barn helping prepare the animal feed. He stood briefly in the open doorway, 
					admiring the beautiful evening. Suddenly the gaze of the 12 year old was held there, for opposite the barn and in a framework of stars, stood a beautiful lady  -  motionless  -  smiling 
					at him.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Do you see anything?" he shouted to the others, "Look, over there!"
				</p>
				<p>
					"Yes," cried his brother Joseph, "a beautiful lady dressed in a blue robe with golden stars, yes, and blue shoes with golden buckles…and, she has a golden crown which is getting 
					bigger, and a black veil."
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the father did not see her, he told the boys to get on with their work; then curiously, he asked, "Eugene, do you still see anything?"
				</p>
				<p>
					"Yes, she's still there," the boy answered and ran to fetch his mother; she saw nothing, but with a woman's intuition, she thought it might be the Blessed Virgin and assembling the 
					family gently, all prayed five Paters and Aves in honor of the Mother of God. She called for a nun at the convent next door, who brought her two little charges with her, the later, 
					Francoise and Jean Marie, reaching the door of the barn, called out, "Oh, look at that lovely lady with the golden stars!" and clapped their hands with delight.
				</p>
				<p>
					The news spread quickly, people gathered, with them the cure, M. Guerin. The Magnificat was intoned, and Eugene shouted, "Look what she is doing!"
				</p>
				<p>
					Slowly a great white streamer unfolded and in large letters they read: "Pray, my children, God will answer your prayers very soon. He will not allow you to be touched."
				</p>
				<p>
					The cure then intoned the hymn: "My Sweet Jesus…" At that a red cross with the wounded body of Christ appeared before the Virgin, who held it. At the top in large red letters was 
					written, "Jesus Christ."
				</p>
				<p>
					The crowd burst into tears, while the cure ordered night prayers to be said; a white veil hid the vision, while our Lady smiled at the children, a smile which haunted them all through 
					life with its beauty. Something of the sorrow of farewell was depicted on the faces of Eugene and Joseph, for the cure said quickly, "Can you still see anything?"
				</p>
				<p>
					"No, it is quite finished," they answered.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the moment the message was being written in the sky, a messenger passing in front of the crowd had shouted, "You may well pray, the Russians are at Laval." But they never entered it.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the 17th of January, at six o'clock at night, the very hour the Virgin appeared to the children of Pontmain, the division of soldiers, without apparent reason, received the order 
					to retire.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the 28th of January, the armistice was signed at Versailles. After long and searching inquiry, Mgr. Wicart, the Bishop of Laval, proclaimed the authenticity of the vision, and at 
					the very spot where Our Lady had appeared, a basilica was erected in honor of Our Lady of Hope of Pontmain. There the Queen of Heaven receives her countless children and gives them 
					fresh hope in their trials, as she gave France peace in her hour of need.
				</p>
				<p>
					The basilica is a magnificent structure in the 13th century style, and one may still see the barn where Eugene and Joseph worked when Mary appeared.
