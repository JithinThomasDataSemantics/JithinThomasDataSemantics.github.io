					The village of Saint-Sulpice-le-Dunois is a small village located near the center of France. Once home to Our Lady D Iron, it is situated near the larger town of 
					Blois, its population was only 517 citizens in the year 2007, which was a decrease from the 636 citizens who had lived there in 1999. It was in the chapel of 
					this tiny village of Saint-Sulpice-le-Dunois, in the year 1631, that our story takes place involving Our Lady D Iron. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a young French couple living in the village at that time who felt themselves singularly blessed. Were they not fortunate? They took pleasure in their 
					youth and enjoyed good health, had gainful employment, owned a modest home, and they had recently been blessed with a fine baby whom they felt was as sweet as 
					the Babe of Bethlehem. Thus they mused on their way home together after early morning Mass one day.
				</p>
				<p>
					As soon as they entered their home, Pierre hurried to the cradle to gaze lovingly at his infant son. The child must have been restless, he thought, as there was 
					evidence that he had struggled with the bedclothes which were tossed about and tangled strangely about the infant. Pierre reached in and lifted his son to hold 
					him in his arms, only to find that the tiny figure was rigid and cold. Stunned, he called for his wife disbelieving, for it seemed their baby was dead!
				</p>
				<p>
					Pierre's thoughts turned to Our Blessed Mother, and then to the statue of Our Lady D Iron at the parish church. They had spent many hours there in the past 
					praying for her assistance, and her help had never failed them. They determined to take their baby there instantly! Surely, Mary would not fail them in this time 
					of dire need.
				</p>
				<p>
					Together they entered the church, and sadly laid the lifeless form at the feet of the statue of Our Lady D Iron. As they began to pray for her intercession, they 
					dedicated their baby to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In that very instant, the child who had been smothered by struggling in its cradle, cried out and came back to 
					life. News of the miracle spread far and wide, and the fame of Our Lady D'Iron was assured.
