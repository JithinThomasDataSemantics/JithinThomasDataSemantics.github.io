					In the year 1212, three merchants from Angers were passing through the forest of Bondy in France, when they were set upon by robbers. After being robbed, they 
					were bound to trees and left to their fate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since it was a wild and lonely place, known to be the haunt of robbers, their chances of rescue were few. They prayed earnestly to God and Our Lady, and, after a 
					day and a night, angels came in visible form and released them.
				</p>
				<p>
					The men discovered a spring near the place where they had been bound, which they considered to be miraculous. They determined to set up a shrine of Our Lady on 
					the spot in thanksgiving for their deliverance.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first statue they put into the shrine was only intended to be temporary, to be used until something better could be made or purchased. However, almost 
					immediately there began a stream of miraculous cures among those who prayed before the rough little statue. In the years that followed, fervent pilgrims came in 
					droves to the shrine, as evidenced by the numerous drinking vessels found during archaeological excavations carried out on the site.
				</p>
				<p>

					The same statue remains today, but it has been richly clothed and decked with jewels. In 1260 the little chapel was enlarged to enclose also the spring. In 1663 
					the chapel was rebuilt and redecorated, and so remained until the French Revolution, when it was completely destroyed. However, after the Terror had passed, the 
					chapel was rebuilt in 1808.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the many thank-offerings in the chapel is a ship suspended above the altar, as an ex-voto from a group of sailors who were saved from shipwreck at the 
					intercession of Our Lady.
				</p>
				<p>
					On Sunday, September 9, 2012, the Diocese of Saint-Denis celebrated the 800th anniversary of the pilgrimage to Notre-Dame-des-Anges in Clichy-sour-Bois, under 
					the leadership of Bishop Pascal Delannoy. The pilgrimage to the small shrine always takes place on the second Sunday of September, and is thought by some to be 
					the second oldest pilgrimage site in France.
