					In July, 1917, the three children of Fatima were granted a vision of hell. They gazed in horror and fear; then they raised their eyes in desperate appeal to Our Lady, who looked down 
					upon them with somber tenderness saying:
				</p>
				<p>
					"You have seen hell, where the souls of poor sinners go. To save them God wants to establish throughout the world the devotion to my Immaculate Heart."
				</p>
				<p>
					"If people will do what I ask, many souls will be saved, and there will be peace. The war is going to end, but if they do not stop offending God, another and worse war will break out in 
					the reign of Pius XII. When you see a night illumined by an unknown light, know that it is the great sign that God gives you that He is going to punish the world for its crimes by means 
					of war, hunger, and persecution.
				</p>
				<p>
					"To forestall this, I shall come to ask the consecration of Russia to my Immaculate Heart and the Communion of Reparation on the First Saturdays."
				</p>
				<p>
					"If they heed my request, Russia will be converted, and there will be peace. If not, she shall spread her errors throughout the world promoting wars and persecutions of the Church: the 
					good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have much to suffer, various nations will be annihilated."
				</p>
				<p>
					"In the end my Immaculate Heart will triumph. The Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me; which will be converted, and some time of peace will be given to the world."
				</p>
				<p>
					In every one of the apparitions, Our Lady of Peace requested the recitation of the rosary. "Continue to say the rosary every day in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary to obtain peace for 
					the world."
