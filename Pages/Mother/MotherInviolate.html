					<em>Here, we have clear hints of Mary's title as Mother Inviolate being defined in relation to the sun.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The sun, in this case, signifies the light which is the deeper metaphorical essence of who Jesus Christ is - the light of the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The relationship between Mary and the sun, symbolizing Jesus Christ, is one of reciprocity: just as the Sun (Jesus Christ) dwells in her virginal person, so also Mary has meaning only in and through the Sun (Jesus Christ).
				</p>
				<p>
					In this painting, even the Jesus monogram ISH - Jesus, Saviour, Son - is imprinted on Mary's chest.
				</p>
				<p>
					With Mary occupying a centre-position, there is the hint that her relationship to the Sun (Jesus Christ) is beyond the changing seasons and times as symbolized by the signs of the Zodiac.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mary, the inviolate mother, is the mirror without stain (Wisdom 7).
				</p>
				<p>
					The light and power of the Holy Spirit traverses her heart and is perfectly reflected because she had kept God's words in her heart and meditated much (Luke 2:17-19).
				</p>
				<p>
					She is inviolately passing on the Spirit's grace so as to bring light into the world (the burning candle) by virginal birth (virginea generatio).
