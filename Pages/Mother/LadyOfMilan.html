					The magnificent Milan Cathedral is a Gothic cathedral that has its roots in the fourth century AD when Milan was a Christian religious center. Today it is one of 
					the most famous and celebrated structures in all of Europe.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dedicated to the Mother of God, the present cathedral was begun in the 14th century, but was not completed until the 20th century when the last gate was 
					completed in 1965. Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte himself ordered that the façade be finished in the year 1805, as he desired to see the beautiful structure 
					completed. He guaranteed that the French would pay for the work, although they never actually did. Even so, it took seven years to complete the work. There were 
					other additions that followed, including stain glass windows and various arches and lace-like spires. There is a large statue of the Blessed Virgin made of 
					gilded bronze which stands atop the cathedral's main spire. In the end it can be said that the cathedral required 6 centuries to complete, and is one of the 
					largest cathedrals in the entire world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first church thought to occupy the location was built by Saint Ambrose, although there is an old baptistery which was constructed in about 335. The good 
					abbot appears to have been incorrect in dating the cathedral from 1388, as there is a plate attached to a stone on the church which states: "El Principio del 
					Duomo di Milano Nel Anno 1386."
				</p>
				<p>
					The Milan Cathedral houses a Holy Nail which was used to crucify Christ. It is marked by a tiny red light located in the dome above the apse.

					The author Mark Twain said of it: "What a wonder it is! So grand, so solemn, so vast! And yet so delicate, so airy, so graceful! A very world of solid weight, 
					and yet it seems…a delusion of frostwork that might vanish with a breath!"
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to the long time that it took to complete the cathedral, it is a breathtaking mixture of styles that was worth the loving labor of the workmen throughout the 
					ages!
