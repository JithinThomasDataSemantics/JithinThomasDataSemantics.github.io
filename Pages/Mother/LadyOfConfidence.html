					On June 25, 1697, a Catholic home in the Eternal City celebrated the birth of a daughter! Little did the happy parents know that Divine Providence had destined 
					this little girl to be a noble instrument in His hands to introduce into the Church one of the most beautiful invocations to the Holy Mother of God: "Madonna 
					della Fiducia" - Our Lady of Confidence.

					My Mother, My Confidence
					A copy of the picture of Our Lady of Confidence  venerated today in the Major Seminary next to the Basilica of Saint John Lateran. It gave rise to a 
					devotion to Our Lady under the title of Mother of Confidence. This renowned reproduction of Our Lady of Confidence arrived at the capital of Christendom 
					accompanied by a copy of a document written by the Servant of God with a promise to those who venerate the picture. The parchment is conserved today in the 
					archives of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which is examining the case for Venerable Sister Clare Isabella's beatification.
					The seminary has always held the picture in great esteem. The students, having recourse to the miraculous image in their most pressing needs, always had their 
					prayers answered by Our Lady. Noteworthy was the complete protection granted by Our Lady of Confidence to the seminarians against the scourge of Asiatic Cholera 
					that claimed thousands of lives throughout Italy in 1837. When a new outbreak devastated the south of the country thirty years later and reached the City of the 
					Pope, the protective mantle of the Madonna was again felt, granting immunity to the students of the seminary. During the First World War, the Blessed Virgin 
					watched over the more than 100 seminarians who had recourse to her with redoubled confidence. Many seminarians were sent to the war and there are numerous 
					letters written from the battlefield recounting the marvels worked by the Madonna for those who had sought her intercession.

					The Promise
					The greatest graces reserved for all those who have this devotion are contained in the promise of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the venerable Sister Clare Isabella. 
					Below is a translation of this marvelous promise taken from an old parchment containing the consoling words of the Blessed Mother to Sister Clare:
					"The divine Lady deigned to reveal to me that every soul that confidently presents herself before this picture will obtain from her Divine Son the general pardon 
					for all her sins. Moreover, my divine Lady assured me with the love of a true mother that she would grant a special tenderness and devotion toward her to 
					everyone who contemplated this picture."
					With the ejaculatory prayer, "My Mother my Confidence," explains a pamphlet published by the Roman seminary, Mary offers everything but asks for nothing. It is a 
					most ardent and efficacious expression of complete abandonment and confidence in the hands of the Blessed Mother. Just as the Apostle Saint Thomas at the feet of 
					the resurrected Redeemer exclaimed with confidence, "My Lord and my God!" so also should devotees of the Virgin, before this miraculous picture, repeat with 
					heartfelt confidence those sweet words,
