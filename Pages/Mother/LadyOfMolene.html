					The Benedictine monastery in the diocese of Langres founded by Saint Robert was actually the famous Molesme Abbey. As the Abbot Orsini mentioned, it was indeed 
					founded by Saint Robert, henceforth known as Saint Robert of Molesme, in the year 1075. He had been the abbot of Saint Michael Abbey, but left and founded a new 
					abbey when they refused to accept his necessary reforms.
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint Robert was born in the year 1029, and had a deep, childlike devotion to the Mother of God  -  by reason of a vision his mother saw before Robert was born  -  
					and he instilled the same into the hearts of his monks. Saint Robert's holiness attracted many sincere men to join him, and as many of them were also noblemen, 
					they provided Saint Robert with the financial means necessary to build a magnificent church. Among those who flocked to Saint Robert was Bruno of Cologne, who 
					was the future founder of the Carthusian Order.
				</p>
				<p>
					When Saint Robert died in the year 1111, he was buried in the church at the abbey he founded. Alberic, Robert's successor, decided that the order should be 
					dedicated to Mary. According to legend, Mary bestowed on Alberic a white mantle; for that reason the monks changed their black habit and wore white. All their 
					churches were dedicated to the Virgin and each had its Mary altar before which the office of Mary was chanted every Saturday.
				</p>
				<p>
					The church and monastery were destroyed and any remaining property stolen in 1472 during the war between Burgundy and France. The Huguenots burned what had been 
					rebuilt the following century during the French Wars of Religion. The end came during the French Revolution when the abbey was suppressed and the buildings and 
					church destroyed.
