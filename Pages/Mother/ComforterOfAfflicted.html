					The title Consoler of the Afflicted is one given to the Virgin Mary because having endured suffering she is able to console those who are afflicted. Blessed John Henry Newman explains 
					the secret of true consolation "those are able to comfort others who, in their own case, have been much tried, and have felt the need of consolation, and have received it."
				</p>
				<p>
					Through her martyrdom, Mary has become in a special way the comfortress of the afflicted. It was by her own experience of sorrow that she was taught the sympathy which enables her to 
					comfort her children in all their afflictions. God gave her a mighty and a sympathetic heart for this great task.
				</p>
				<p>
					ST. PAUL says that his Lord comforted him in all his tribulations, that he also might be able to comfort them who are in distress, by the encouragement which he received from God. This 
					is the secret of true consolation: those are able to comfort others who, in their own case, have been much tried, and have felt the need of consolation, and have received it. So of our 
					Lord Himself it is said: "In that He Himself hath suffered and been tempted, He is able to succour those also that are tempted."
				</p>
				<p>
					And this too is why the Blessed Virgin is the comforter of the afflicted. We all know how special a mother's consolation is, and we are allowed to call Mary our Mother from the time 
					that our Lord from the Cross established the relation of mother and son between her and St. John. And she especially can console us because she suffered more than mothers in general. 
					Women, at least delicate women, are commonly shielded from rude experience of the highways of the world; but she, after our Lord's Ascension, was sent out into foreign lands almost as 
					the Apostles were, a sheep among wolves. In spite of all St. John's care of her, which was as great as was St. Joseph's in her younger days, she, more than all the saints of God, was a 
					stranger and a pilgrim upon earth, in proportion to her greater love of Him who had been on earth, and had gone away. As, when our Lord was an Infant, she had to flee across the desert 
					to the heathen Egypt, so, when He had ascended on high, she had to go on shipboard to the heathen Ephesus, where she lived and died.
				</p>
				<p>
					For all God's children, the way to heaven leads across the mount of Calvary -- the way of trial and suffering. In the company of our Sorrowful Mother we walk more easily, fight more 
					courageously, and suffer more patiently, perseveringly and joyfully; for she holds up before us not only the example of the sufferings and death of her Divine Son, but also the victory, 
					the joy and the glory which He has won through His sufferings.
				</p>
				<p>
					How often do we grow impatient, fainthearted, despondent and in constant in suffering, without endurance, without resignation, full of complaints and murmurings! Oh! let us deeply 
					engrave in our hearts the sorrows of Mary. May she, our Sorrowful Mother, ever be our model in suffering, in the patient endurance of trials, and in the humble acceptance of sorrows and 
					afflictions. When the hand of God lays a heavy cross upon our shoulders, let us turn to Mary Sorrowing, and we shall obtain consolation and strength to carry the cross patiently and 
					meritoriously.
