					"If any man minister to Me, him will My Father honor," says Our Lord. Who ever ministered to Jesus, served Jesus, waited on Jesus, as did His Holy Mother Mary? And as no one ever was so 
					faithful to His promises as Jesus ("Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away"), so has this promise of Our Lord been most literally fulfilled.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Lady's own prophecy, "All generations shall call Me blessed," bears out this truth. In Sacred Scripture, in the Church, throughout all ages, Our Lady has been honored as no creature 
					has ever been.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Apostles looked upon Her as their Queen, and held Her in the highest veneration. The most learned of the great Doctors of the Church consecrated volumes to Her praise and to the 
					explanation of Her dignity, excellence, graces, and virtues.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Church has in every age kept up this tradition. Benediction was frequently accompanied by Her Litany, or some other chant in Her honor, the Ave Maria, the Salve Regina, and 
					countless others. The most beautiful music of the Church's liturgy has been reserved for Her hymns and antiphons. The Divine Office ends every day with an antiphon to Her. Her feasts 
					run through every month of the year, and the whole of the month of May is Hers. The month of August is dedicated to Her Immaculate Heart and Her Assumption; the month of September to 
					Her Nativity and Her life-long Sorrows; and the month of October to Her Holy Rosary. Her shrines are to be found all over the world, where in every age She has shown Herself to men. 
					Processions, hymns and devotions honor Her all the year round. What a distinguished place She holds even in the great Feasts of Her Son! They are nearly as much Hers as His, especially 
					the Offices of Advent and Christmas. A statue of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary is one of the distinguishing marks of a truly Catholic church. Countless books have been written about Her 
					and many new Feasts in Her honor have been added to the liturgical cycle throughout the ages. Every true Pope has tried to do something special for Her. Her holy Name is invoked by 
					every true Catholic, morning and evening; the Angelus three times a day keeps Her ever in our minds; Her medals, pictures and statues form part of every Catholic's life. Nothing is done 
					in the Church without Her. Our Lord's promise is daily fulfilled. And in Heaven, He still shows Her the honor due to a mother, as the writings and revelations of the Saints testify.
				</p>
				<p>
					"He that honoreth his mother, heapeth up a treasure." Let us, too, take our part in this universal homage paid to the Mother of God. Every sigh, every look to Her, every act in Her 
					honor, is treasured up by Jesus and by Her, and will have its reward. If there is one truth more universally witnessed to than another, it is that no act of devotion to Mary goes 
					unrewarded. A holy writer says: "All who honor Mary in this world, will be honored by Her in the next."
				</p>
				<p>
					We may consider this title under another aspect. The value of a gem is argued from the costliness of the setting that encases it, how carefully it is treated, and with what care it is 
					handled, because of what it contains. But Mary was the shrine which contained the great God, the Creator of the world. What honor, what reverence, then, is due to Her! How strict was 
					the watch She kept over every act and thought, so that nothing unworthy of Her high estate might be found in Her. How high-principled, how honorable in all Her dealings must She have 
					been. Like Her, each one of us should also be a vessel of honor, for we so often receive Our Lord in Holy Communion. She was seen in vision as "the Woman clothed with the sun." After 
					Holy Communion we are all "clothed with the Sun," the Sun of Justice; we are all penetrated and saturated with Jesus. Let us then do nothing to lower or degrade ourselves either in body 
					or soul; let us be honorable in all our dealings, true and straight and just, that we also may deserve to be called, each in his own degree, "vessels of honor."
