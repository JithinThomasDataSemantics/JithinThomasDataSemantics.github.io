				<p>
					Here at Olion, in Catalonia, Spain, Our Lady was once venerated under the title of Our Lady of Castelbruedo, or Nuestra Senora de Castelbruedo. The lamps and the 
					wax candles of the church were likewise lighted by invisible hands, and all disappeared three days after the feast, on the twenty-eighth of March. Despite all 
					subsequent investigations, the lights and their extinguishing could not be accounted for; but it was universally taken for granted that all this was all to honor 
					Our Lady and her great feast.

				<p>
					The church at Olion referred to by the good abbot must be one that was once located in Oliana, Spain, and not Olion, as it appears there is no such city in 
					Spain. Oliana is in Catalonia, and is a very small municipality of a few hundred inhabitants in the Sergre valley just below the Oliana reservoir. There is no 
					Catholic church there anymore, however, and the only church anywhere nearby is the church of Sant Climent near Coll de Nargo, which appears to be about 6 miles 
					away. It dates from the 11th century, but looks as if it is little more than an abandoned structure. The region is popular now with those involved with the sport 
					of rock-climbing.

					I can find no further information about this site. If anyone has any information on this Marian title, please forward it to me for inclusion on this website and 
					for the edification of all Catholics.
