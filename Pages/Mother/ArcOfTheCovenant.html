					<p>Explanation for the reference of Mother Mary as the Ark of the New Covenant will take us on a thrilling journey through the Old and New Testaments.<br/>
					</p>				
					<P><strong>Arc of the Old Covenant</strong><br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						God loved his people and wanted to be close to them. He chose to do so in a very special way. The Catechism of the Catholic Church says, "The prayer of the people of God flourished in the shadow of the dwelling place of God's presence on earth, the ark of the covenant and the temple, under the guidance of their shepherds, especially King David, and of the prophets" (CCC 2594). God instructed Moses to build a tabernacle surrounded by heavy curtains (cf. Ex 25-27). Within the tabernacle he was to place an ark made of acacia wood covered with gold inside and out. Within the Ark of the Covenant was placed a golden jar holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant (cf. Heb 9:4).
					</p>	
					<p>
						When the ark was completed, the glory cloud of the Lord (the Shekinah Glory) covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (Ex 40:34-35; Nm 9:18, 22). The verb for "to cover" or "to overshadow" and the metaphor of a cloud are used in the Bible to represent the presence and glory of God.
					</p>	
					<p>
						It's easy to miss the parallel between the Holy Spirit overshadowing the ark and the Holy Spirit overshadowing Mary, between the Ark of the Old Covenant as the dwelling place of God and Mary as the new dwelling place of God.
					</p>	
					<p>
						God was very specific about every exact detail of the ark (Ex 25-30). It was a place where God himself would dwell (Ex 25:8). God wanted his words - inscribed on stone - housed in a perfect container covered with pure gold within and without. How much more would he want his Word - Jesus - to have a perfect dwelling place! If the only begotten Son were to take up residence in the womb of a human girl, would he not make her flawless?

						<strong><em>Following are the bible references which relates Mother Mary and Arc Of The Covenant</em></strong>
					</p>	
					<p>				
						The ark traveled to the house of Obed-edom in the hill country of Judea (2 Sam. 6:1-11).<br/>
						Mary traveled to the house of Elizabeth and Zechariah in the hill country of Judea (Luke 1:39).<br/>
					</p>	
					<p>
						Dressed as a priest, David danced and leapt in front of the ark (2 Sam. 6:14).	<br/>
						John the Baptist - of priestly lineage - leapt in his mother's womb at the approach of Mary (Luke 1:41).<br/>
					</p>	
					<p>
						David asks, "How can the ark of the Lord come to me?" (2 Sam. 6:9).	<br/>
						Elizabeth asks, "Why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?" (Luke 1:43).<br/>
					</p>	
					<p>
						David shouts in the presence of the ark (2 Sam. 6:15).	<br/>
						Elizabeth "exclaimed with a loud cry" in the presence of the Mary (Luke 1:42).<br/>
					</p>	
					<p>
						The ark remained in the house of Obed-edom for three months (2 Sam. 6:11).	<br/>
						Mary remained in the house of Elizabeth for three months (Luke 1:56).<br/>
					</p>	
					<p>
						The house of Obed-edom was blessed by the presence of the ark (2 Sam. 6:11).	<br/>
						The word blessed is used three times; surely the house was blessed by God (Luke 1:39-45).<br/>
					</p>	
					<p>
						The ark returns to its home and ends up in Jerusalem, where God's presence and glory is revealed in the temple (2 Sam. 6:12; 1 Kgs. 8:9-11).<br/>
						Mary returns home and eventually ends up in Jerusalem, where she presents God incarnate in the temple (Luke 1:56; 2:21-22).	<br/>
					</p><br/>

					<strong><em>Mary as the Ark Revealed by Items inside the Ark</em></strong>

					<p>
						The stone tablets of the law - the word of God inscribed on stone<br/>	
						The body of Jesus Christ - the word of God in the flesh<br/>
					</p>	
					<p>
						The urn filled with manna from the wilderness - the miraculous bread come down from heaven<br/>	
						The womb containing Jesus, the bread of life come down from heaven (John 6:41)<br/>
					</p>	
					<p>
						The rod of Aaron that budded to prove and defend the true high priest<br/>	
						The actual and eternal High Priest<br/>
