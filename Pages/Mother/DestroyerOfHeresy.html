					The Church has always accorded Our Lady this title as She Who Destroys All Heresies, from the very beginning since we know from the account of the fall of our first parents, that Satan 
					would be punished anew for his having deceived them: that he would wait for Our Lady's heel to crush him and his seed: among those seeds are the lies of heresy as he is the Father of 
					Lies. The first act of disobedience was in the fore-heaven by Lucifer and his rebel Angels. The first heretical act was in the Garden of Paradise: that man had the right to choose for 
					himself what is good and what is evil, not Almighty God.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Lady has always been instrumental in crushing heresy as the lives of the sainted Pontiffs and the Saints attest. No Saint, Pope or otherwise ever succeeded in stamping out or 
					crushing a heresy in his time without having a special devotion to the Mother of God.

					Pope Pius X invokes the Blessed Virgin Mary by the title Destroyer of all heresies. He took this curious appellation for the gentle, sweet maiden of 
					Nazareth from the Mass of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The title had particular meaning in Pascendi, which was written in 1911 against modernism, the "synthesis of all heresies." Faced 
					with that crisis, it was proper to appeal to the Destroyer of all heresies. The title still applies, however. Indeed, it describes something that has always been true of our Lady  -  
					and is perhaps even more urgent now.

					Today we see another dimension of Mary as the Destroyer of all heresies: she defends the truth about the human person. Specifically, by her Assumption, she reveals and destroys the 
					error that plagues us now: the error about the human body. Today's heresy (seen most of all in the new Gnosticism of gender ideology) is a recapitulation of an ancient, recurring 
					error. Rather than knowing man to be an embodied soul, we see him as a soul that happens to have (or be trapped in) a body. To be human thus means to be a soul  -  and do with the body as you will. The body becomes a plaything, a tool, a possession, a curse, etc. Indulge it while you are healthy, and discard 
					it when you are not. The body means nothing and tells you nothing about yourself. You can be one thing physically and another spiritually.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mary, assumed into heaven, reveals the truth and upends the errors. All saints are in heaven spiritually. They await the last day when their bodies will be raised and reunited with 
					their souls. Our Lady, however, assumed body and soul into heaven, already enjoys perfect blessedness in the fullness of her human nature. In her very being she teaches the essential 
					union of body and soul. Her Assumption has to be understood as one with her entire life. By her Immaculate Conception, Mary is kept free from original sin and its effects. She does not suffer the opposition 
					of body and soul that the rest of us do. Her perpetual virginity further confirms and reveals this perfect union. Her body and soul are so perfectly one that her body participates in 
					and manifests that pure spiritual gift of herself to God.
