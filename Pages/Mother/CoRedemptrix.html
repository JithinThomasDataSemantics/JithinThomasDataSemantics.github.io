					"The title, "Co-redemptix," refers to Mary's unique participation with and under her Divine Son Jesus Christ, in the historic Redemption of humanity. The prefix, "Co," comes from the 
					Latin "cum," which means "with." The title of Coredemptrix applied to the Mother of Jesus never places Mary on a level of equality with Jesus Christ, the divine Lord of all, in the 
					saving process of humanity's Redemption. Rather, it denotes Mary's singular and unique sharing with her Son in the saving work of Redemption for the human family. The Mother of Jesus 
					participates in the redemptive work of her Savior Son, who alone could reconcile humanity with the Father in his glorious divinity and humanity."
				</p>
				<p>
					Mary's entire existence has been one of cooperation with the Lord. So it was on Calvary. She who was preserved by God from Original Sin at the moment of her conception and heard from 
					the mouth of Simeon that "you yourself a sword will pierce so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed" accepted the salvific death of her Son not with a "hands-off" approach 
					but instead by embracing it. The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council (1962-1965), in its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Lumen Gentium) of November 21, 1964, painted the picture of 
					Our Blessed Lady's collaboration with the Almighty, which included her heroic surrender to Christ's ignominious death.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Thus the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross, where she stood, in keeping with the divine plan, 
					enduring with her only begotten Son the intensity of his suffering, associated herself with his sacrifice in her mother's heart, and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this victim 
					which was born of her."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Mary uniquely participated in the sacrifice of Jesus on Calvary and in the acquisition of the graces of Redemption for humanity (theologically referred to as "objective redemption"). 
					Mary offered her Son and her maternal rights in relation to her Son to the Heavenly Father in perfect obedience to God's will and in atonement for the sins of the world. Mary's offering 
					of her own Son on Calvary, along with her own motherly compassion, rights and suffering, offered in union with her Son for the salvation of the human family, merited more graces than 
					any other created person. As Pope Pius XII confirmed in his encyclical On the Mystical Body, Mary "offered Him on Golgotha to the Eternal Father, together with the holocaust of her 
					maternal rights and her motherly love, like a New Eve for all children of Adam."
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite her enormous grief as she watched her Son die, Our Lady generously "yielded" Jesus to the purpose the Father through the Holy Spirit intended, namely the reconciliation of the 
					human race to its Creator. Although what Mary did on Calvary was secondary and subordinate to what Christ did, it was, nevertheless, necessary because God made it so. In His 
					unparalleled wisdom, the Lord required this all-encompassing--and real--sacrifice from Mary, who said her fiat with incredible trust in God as she had at the Annunciation.
