					How often in the Gospel Our Lord instructs us by some example drawn from Nature. He tells us to look at the birds and observe how God feeds them day by day, how 
					He takes care of the sparrows, so that not one falls to the ground dead, without His noticing it. We are bid to admire the beauty of the flowers of the field; 
					not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of them. Christ spoke of the common things He saw around Him, of the vines, the fig-trees, the corn-fields 
					ripe for the harvest, the cockle among the wheat, the sheep and the shepherds, water, bead and wine, trees and fruits, seed-time and harvest-time; and from all 
					these common, homely objects He drew spiritual lessons for our benefit.
				</p>
				<p>	
					If we turn to the Old Testament, the Book of Wisdom especially, we find the same truth insisted on - that we are to learn from natural objects and the daily 
					occurrences around us, from the ant and the bee, from the birds, and the insects, and the seasons.
				</p>
				<p>	
					All this should bring home to us the truth that in every cranny of the world of Nature we can find some divinely intended lesson - that the things of the earth, 
					passing as they are, are shadows, emblems, and types of things spiritual and eternal.
				</p>
				<p>	
					What then is the lesson of flowers? We may look upon them as representing the beauty of virtues. The rose, for instance, which we call the queen of flowers, 
					stands for charity, the queen of virtues. All the most lovely things in Nature are pressed into service to bring home to us the beauty of Mary's soul - flowers, 
					gardens, stars.
				</p>
				<p>	
					And as the rose reigns by universal consent as the lovely queen of flowers, so Mary, the Woman clothed with the sun, which is charity, shines as the fairest 
					flower in God's garden and is acclaimed as the "Mystical Rose." Our Lord has told us quite plainly that love for one another is the distinctive mark of His 
					disciples. "By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love one for another."
				</p>
				<p>	
					Never was there anyone who loved God and Her neighbor as did Mary. Our Lord said: "If you love Me, keep My commandments... This is My commandment, that you love 
					one another."
				</p>
				<p>	
					Think for a moment how Mary practiced this commandment. We have already gazed upon Her in Her charity at the Visitation, bringing to Elizabeth the grace She had 
					just received. Her first thought is to share it with another. At the marriage feast, Her love and compassion force Her, who was always so silent and retiring, to 
					speak two out of the seven words (phrases) of Hers which are on record. To Our Lord She says: "They have no wine." Her quick sympathy made Her dread the 
					discomfiture of Her hosts at this humiliation - so sweet, so compassionate is She. To the waiters, in Her eagerness to give help, She says: "Whatsoever He shall 
					say to you, do ye."
				</p>
				<p>	
					St. Thomas says that he who loves God, loves all that God loves. St. Catherine of Genoa one day said to Our Lord: "Lord, Thou willest that I should love my 
					neighbor, and I can love none but Thee." And Our Lord said: "All who love Me love what I love." And we have seen that what Our Lord loves above all is souls, the 
					souls that He died to save. St. Bonaventure tells us that it was said of Mary that She was "eager to serve." "See," he says, speaking of the marriage feast of 
					Cana, "see Our Lady eager to serve, solicitous, alert in handling things round, and directing the servants how and what to offer to the guests."
				</p>
				<p>	
					What a great and admirable thing that is, to be eager to serve others! We should all aim at this: it will be the remedy for many of our faults, for pride and 
					selfishness and vanity and self-occupation, and it will make us resemble Jesus and Mary, for Jesus says of Himself, "I am in the midst of you as one that 
					serveth." Let this be our first thought wherever we may be, "How can I help?"
				</p>
				<p>	
					Mary loves what Her Divine Son loves, and hence She loves souls. On Calvary, when She saw Jesus, Her one Treasure, tortured, agonizing, bleeding, insulted, there 
					was no ill-will against the executioners in Her mind, but She freely offered Her Son for their salvation and that of the whole world. Like Jesus, She "loved to 
					the end."
				</p>
				<p>	
					But we must not be satisfied with merely gazing upon Our Mother, the Mystical Rose, we must strive with all our hearts to imitate Her in Her love for God and 
					man. We shall then be Her little mystical rosebuds, and She will look down on and bless these blossoms of Her own beloved virtue. "Be ye merciful, as your 
					Heavenly Mother is merciful," we may imagine Mary saying to us.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Let the thought of Our Mother, as the Mystical Rose of Charity, help us then, to fight those difficulties in the way of charity which everyone must have. Charity 
					is not an easy virtue, though by practice it becomes delightful. There is the difficulty of forgiving those who have hurt us, who annoy us, who dislike us, of 
					being kind to those who are unkind to us, not saying sharp things when we are cross and hurt, and of overcoming selfishness in all its manifestations, fighting 
					for what we like, and what we want, not caring at all what others like or want.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Remember Mary's words: "They have no wine." Her one thought was to spare others suffering, shame, and confusion, and even when Jesus said that His hour was not 
					yet come, She still exerted Herself to help: "Whatsoever He shall say to you, do ye." Do not, then, always wait till you are asked to do a kind deed. Be on the 
					watch to see how you can serve others and help them, and you will, in your own sphere, resemble your Mother, the Mystical Rose, in Her love and charity.
