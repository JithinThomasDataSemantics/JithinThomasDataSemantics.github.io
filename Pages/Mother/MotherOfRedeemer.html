					"When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son." Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your 
					mother." And from that hour the disciple took her into his home (John 19:26, 27). This tender scene speaks to us of the depth of the Love which inspires, 
					informs, and transforms all human love, the Love Incarnate who gives us His Mother.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Christian Art and the Tradition of the Church are filled with reflection on the profound mystery and implications of this gift of a Mother named Mary to the 
					Church. She was a real mother who was privileged to, (along with Joseph), raise the One who lived within her for nine months after He was born. In her presence 
					and with her human influence, the biblical texts tell us He "grew in wisdom and stature" in His Sacred humanity (Luke 2:52).
				</p>
				<p>	
					In the undivided Church, East and West, for the first 1,000 years, devotion to and love of Mary was a shining light of the profound prayers, reflections and 
					writings of the Christian Church. When  one probes the lives of Augustine of Hippo, Bernard of Clairveaux, Therese of Liseux, the Theresa of Calcutta and 
					so many others within the western Christian tradition.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Jesus called her "Mother" and he entrusted her, as one of his last and greatest gifts to his beloved disciple and to the entire Church with these tender words 
					of entrustment in the Gospel of John: "When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son." Then he 
					said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her into his home" (John 19:26, 27).
				</p>
				<p>	
					Mary was there at the Incarnation, Birth, Crucifixion, and Resurrection of God Incarnate. She was there throughout the often called "hidden years" in Nazareth. 
					In the life of the Redeemer, every word and every act was redemptive, revealing as it does the very life of God, the mystery of heaven touching earth, and the 
					deeper purpose of our own lives. She was there in those moments whose impact is timeless. They are still as filled with the invitation of grace today as they 
					were when they first occurred.
				</p>
				<p>	
					She was there on the great day of Pentecost, the birthday of the Church. She was there as the first evangelizer and disciple who gave the first Christian 
					testimony to her cousin, Elizabeth, and won the first convert "in utero" in the person of John the Baptist. This event, traditionally called "The Visitation," is 
					recorded in the Gospel of St. Luke (Luke l: 39-45).
				</p>
				<p>	
					This encounter immediately follows the visit of the Angel Gabriel to Mary (Luke 1:6-38) and is one of the fruits of her humble obedient response. That response 
					was not a onetime reaction. It was the fruit of a life of surrender and stretched forward to characterize her whole life on this earth and her participation in 
					the eternal communion of Saints. The Prayer of Mary is more about being than doing. It is about surrendered love to God.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Her "Fiat" (Latin, let it be done) in response to the visitation from the messenger of heaven, the angel, provides a pattern of prayer and a way to live for us. 
					It immediately issues forth in the fruit of her praise, her "Magnificat." She said "Yes" to the invitation to love and she humbled herself. She confronted her 
					own fears and she entered into a way of living. All of this was in continued response to an original invitation of love, a gift, initiated by a loving God.
