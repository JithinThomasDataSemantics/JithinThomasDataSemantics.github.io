					Bethlehem, the city of David, is located about 5 miles south of the city of Jerusalem. According to tradition, Bethlehem is the place where David was born, and 
					also where he was anointed king by the prophet Samuel.
				</p>
				<p>
					We do not know not long the Holy Family remained in Bethlehem, but, regardless, often in later years on their way from Nazareth to Jerusalem to pray in the 
					Temple, they must have stopped off at Bethlehem. There, they might have visited the place of the Divine Birth and talked with the shepherds and those of the town 
					who befriended them and were kind to them during the time of the Nativity.
				</p>
				<p>
					How they must have stood, pondering on the events now past, as their gaze fell on the road which they had taken to Egypt to escape Herod's wrath. The text, "And 
					thou, Bethlehem, are not the least of the cities of Judah, for out of thee shall come the Savior who will deliver His people from their sins," must have been 
					frequently on their lips, as they in gratitude called down a blessing on the city of Bethlehem, for having given them the shelter it had on that glorious night 
					of the Nativity, that "Silent Night, Holy Night."
