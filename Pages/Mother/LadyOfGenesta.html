				<p>
					There is no shrine of Our Lady of Genesta, or a city in Italy by the name of Genesta, near Genoa or anywhere else. Initially, it seemed likely that it might have 
					been a town later absorbed into Genoa, or that the town simply no longer exists. There are several ancient churches in France dedicated to Saint Genest, but 
					these are not near Genoa. I regret that I can find no information on this date for the Marian Calendar.
				</p>
				<p>
					The story of the woman named Petruccia, however, is an entirely different matter. Her story, and the story of the church, are actually associated with Our Lady 
					of Genazzano. Petruccia is Petruccia de Nocera, and she was a Third Order Augustinian intent on restoring a church under the care of the hermits of Saint 
					Augustine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Petruccia had been left with a good deal of money after the death of her husband in the year 1436, and decided to use it to restore the church where she spent 
					much of her time in prayer. She did not have enough money to complete the work, but she trusted that others would come forward to finish what was left when her 
					money ran out.
				</p>
				<p>
					A grand new church was begun, but Petruccia ran out of funds after only the first part of the construction had begun. People began to insult her and make fun of 
					her for wasting her money, and even friends turned on her to mock her. She would patiently answer them:
				</p>
				<p>
					"My dear children, do not put too much importance on this apparent misfortune. I assure you that before my death the Blessed Virgin and our holy father Augustine 
					will finish the church begun by me."
				</p>
				<p>
					Petruccia was not wrong. On the 25th of April, 1467, in the middle of the afternoon, a crowd began to gather in front of the unfinished church of Our Mother of 
					Good Counsel when the chords of a beautiful melody could be heard, a melody that seemed to come from a luminous cloud that came down upon the church. The cloud 
					stopped against one wall of the church when the bells of the church began to ring by themselves, as well as all of the bells located anywhere around the town.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the little cloud dissipated, a beautiful image was revealed to the faithful, a painting of Our Lady tenderly holding her Divine Son in her arms. The 
					painting was hovering in the air, and although it did not move, it was not attached to the wall. It remains that way to this day. Miracles and wonders began to 
					occur before the image of the Virgin Mary.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fame of the miraculous cures spread far and wide, attracting crowds of pilgrims. The visitors gladly gave alms for the completion of the church, validating 
					the confidence Petruccia had in the Blessed Virgin.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sometime later the marvel was explained when two foreigners entered the city wearing strange clothing and speaking a foreign tongue. They told the story of how 
					they had followed the cloud from Albania, walking upon the waters of the sea, when the image had departed their homeland after the death of Iskander before the 
					advance of the invading Turks.
