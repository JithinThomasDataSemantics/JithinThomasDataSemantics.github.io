					La Couronne, or "the Crown," is a town in France located to the south-west of Angouleme. The Abbey of Our Lady of La Couronne is nothing more now than a pile of ruins that remain from 
					what was once a Benedictine monastery. The first high abbey dates from the 12th century, when on May 12, 1118, Lambert and his religious brothers laid the cornerstone of the Church of 
					the Crown.
				</p>
				<p>
					On March 12th, on Passion Sunday in the year 1122, the religious make their entry into the primitive church of the Crown in the presence of Bishop William of Perigueux and Bishop Gerard 
					of Angouleme, as well as the Papal Legate Wulgrin II, the count of Angouleme. Lambert was elected to be the first abbot, and was consecrated on Easter Sunday.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first Abbey Church was replaced by a second, and larger, church, which was necessitated by the spiritual renewal that took place at the end of the 12th century due to the Gregorian 
					reform. It was consecrated in the year 1201 while Junius was abbot.
				</p>
				<p>
					The abbey suffered heavy damage during the Hundred Years War, although the two western bays of the nave and the fa√ßade were subsequently rebuilt in the Gothic style. The church was then 
					again damaged during the French wars of religion. Seized as a national asset during the French Revolution, the grounds were used as a quarry until it the property became an historical 
					Monument in 1903. Even so, the plundering of some of the buildings continued for nearly another century until all of the ruins became protected in the year 1999.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are now tours where families spend a few moments casually strolling through the empty and lifeless ruins where once hundreds of prayerful monks spent their entire lives in 
					solitude and service to God.
