				Saint Beatrice de Silva was born of Portuguese parents at Ceuta on Moroccan soil, and manifested a special attachment to our Immaculate Mother very early in life. At the court of the 
				king of Castile she was presented and cast into prison by a jealous queen, but by the visible intervention of the Immaculate Queen of heaven, she was released and justified with great 
				honor. Then she left the court and went to Toledo. On the journey thither St Francis and St Anthony appeared to her and announced that she would be the founder of a new order.
				</p>

				At Toledo Saint Beatrice de Silva repaired to a convent of Cistercian nuns and remained there for almost 40 years. She did not don the religious garb; nevertheless she was a model of 
				religious perfection. Gradually the resolution took shape to establish a new order that would honor the Immaculate Mother of God. With 12 companions who entertained sentiments similar 
				to hers, she withdrew to a separate house. Beatrice wrote the rule and asked Pope Innocent VIII to approve it. This occurred in the year 1489.

				A few years earlier the Blessed Virgin had showed Saint Beatrice de Silva in a vision that she should wear a habit consisting of a white tunic and scapular with a light blue mantle. 
				This was the origin of the Order of the Immaculate Conception, also known as the Conceptionist Poor Clares.

				The whole life of the foundress was conformed to her religious rule. The rule itself can be summed up briefly in three short mottos: to be silent and submissive in all things that 
				happen to us by God's ordinance or are required of us by holy obedience; to become small in the eyes of God, of the world, and of ourselves, and to prefer a life of obscurity; to love 
				everyone with a holy love, and become all to all by prayer, sacrifice, and labor.
				</p>
				<p>
				At the age of 65, Mother Beatrice departed from this life in 1492, a year after the founding of her order. Pope Pius XI enrolled her among the beatified. The Conceptionists were 
				incorporated into the Franciscan Order and soon spread through Europe and America. Thanks to the efforts of the Franciscan bishop, Amandus Bahlmann of Santarem, a branch of this order, 
				under the name of Missionaries of the Immaculate Conception, is doing remarkable work especially in the missions of Brazil. Their motherhouse is at Patterson, New Jersey.
