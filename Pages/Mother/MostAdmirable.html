					A young girl, still an adolescent, is suddenly faced with a being who says he is from God. She doesn't run. She is calm as she listens to his words. He tells her 
					that she - who is engaged to a man from her village - will bear a child, in spite of never having known man. She realizes that there will be shame for her from the 
					village. Yet, she quietly accepts this news, along with the command to travel to visit her cousin, Elizabeth, who is also with child.  She does not flinch. This 
					young, newly-pregnant girl, trusting in the word of the messenger, takes off on her journey.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nine months later, in obedience to the rule of the land, this young girl - heavy with child - again jostles over rocky terrain on the back of a donkey. Upon reaching 
					the requisite destination, she retires to a smelly, dirty stable, with farm animals as her companions. Into this squalid setting, she brings forth her son. She 
					does not question that this is the son of God. A few days later she and her spouse and new baby travel to a far-off land, again in faith at the behest of the Lord.
				</p>
				<p>
					The young mother does not flinch at the word of those who tell her that because of this babe, a sword shall pierce her heart. As he matures and she temporarily 
					panics at his loss, she is rebuked by this same son as he tells her that she should once again have faith. She calmly accepts chastisement when she calls upon 
					her son to assist at a marriage feast.
				</p>
				<p>
					The final heart-wrenching blows come as she watches this babe she has loved ridiculed and tortured to the point of death by those he came to save. Yet, she 
					trusts that he is the son of God and the redeemer of mankind.
				</p>
				<p>
					The story isn't new. However, In Mater Admirabilis we see the docile, submissive personification of this young girl. She comes to us as an image telling us that 
					we - students and teachers alike - can emulate the qualities of Mary, whom we regard as our mother and guide. She reminds us that as students we, too, have the power 
					to follow the Lord in love and trust. She meekly goes about her tasks, just as children of the Sacred Heart comply with their prescribed assignments. She is our 
					Mother Most Admirable, for this image sums up her life of obedience, deference, and love - characteristics sought by students and teachers of the Sacred Heart.
