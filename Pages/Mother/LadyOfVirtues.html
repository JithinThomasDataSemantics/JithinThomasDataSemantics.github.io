					The Church of the monastery of Our Lady of Virtues, or Nossa Senhora de Virtudes in Portuguese, is now nothing more than a ruin located north of Lisbon, Portugal. It is now protected 
					because of its historical importance, and for no other reason.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to tradition, the origin of the Church of Our Lady of Virtues relates to the appearance of Our Lady to a keeper of cows back in the early fifteenth century. The apparition 
					gave rise to a pilgrimage to the site, as well as the later construction of a primitive chapel, presumably made of wood and other perishable materials. A short time later, due to the 
					growing importance of the site and the devotion of the faithful that he saw going on around him, King Duarte commanded that a Franciscan monastery be built that would be attached to the 
					chapel. Following upon the construction of the monastery, a hospital was also soon built, and then subsequently inns and other businesses supporting the thriving community that grew up 
					around the chapel. Pilgrimages to the shrine became widespread throughout the remainder of the fifteenth century.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of unquestionable importance throughout the Middle Ages, the more recent centuries have seen the abandonment of pilgrimages to the shrine, as well as the decay of the buildings and the 
					eventual abandonment of the site by the Franciscans. At the beginning of the 1990's, when excavations were made at the monastery, all that remained was ruins. Despite the fact that the 
					monastery was almost completely destroyed, there are still some structural remains located on the north side of the church, and most of these structures are assumed to still be buried 
					beneath the earth. This is believed because the church of Our Lady of Virtues itself was partially buried before the archaeological work was begun to reveal it.
