					The shrine of Our Lady of Esquernes lies a half league from Lille, in Flanders, France. This image began to work miracles about the year 1162, and is still 
					greatly venerated for the wonders which Mary continues to work through her intercession.

				<p>
					Legend tells that while the painter responsible for the image of Mary at the above mentioned shrine, was putting forth all his effort and talent to depict the 
					Mother of God as beautiful as might be possible to conceive by the human mind. The Devil tried to intervene. The Virgin suspended the painter in mid-air until 
					the Bishop arrived to pronounce exorcism, and the Evil One molested the painter no further.
