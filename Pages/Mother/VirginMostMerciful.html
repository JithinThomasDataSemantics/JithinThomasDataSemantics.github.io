					The prudent Virgins of the Parable would not give any of their oil to their sisters in need, for fear of not having enough left for themselves; but Mary, the Virgo Prudentissima, the 
					Most Prudent Virgin, is so full of grace, mercy, and compassion, that She is not only able, but willing, to supply oil (which signifies mercy) to all who invoke Her. She is "rich unto 
					all that call upon Her." "Until the world to come," She once told a Saint, "I shall not cease to be the Mother of Mercy."
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Hail Holy Queen, we salute Our Lady as Mother of Mercy. Mercy is Her most distinctive virtue and characteristic. No one else bears this title.
				</p>
				<p>
					What does Mercy mean? The Latin word misericordia expresses more than our "mercy;" it means, literally, "a heart for the miserable," that is, a heart full of compassion for those who 
					are suffering, a heart ready to pardon and forgive. Clemency, as in the title Virgo Clemens, means showing mercy to the guilty who have deserved punishment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now if there is one thing we all need, it is mercy, clemency. We are all sinners, we all need forgiveness. "Forgive us our trespasses," Our Lord instructs us all to say in His Prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Blessed Lady realizes far more than we can ever do, how great is our wretchedness when we have sinned, and so She longs with an earnestness we cannot picture to obtain for us pardon 
					and mercy. This is Her own special office - to show mercy, clemency, forgiveness. Whenever we say these words, "Virgin Most Merciful," we should call to mind that we are sinners, in need 
					of mercy, of Mary's powerful help, and beg Her to obtain for us the great grace of an abiding sorrow for our sins. Go to Her in all your trials, for no friend or dear one on earth has 
					more than a fraction of the sympathy and compassion that She feels for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					We must also try, in honor of the clemency of Our Mother, the Virgin Most Merciful, to show mercy and compassion in our turn to all who suffer. "As you do to others, so also will My 
					Heavenly Father do to you." We must be merciful in thought, word, and deed. "Judge not, and you shall not be judged."
				</p>
				<p>
					Of the "valiant woman," who is a type of Mary, we read that "the law of clemency is on her tongue," that is, all she says is inspired by tenderness and mercy. Note that the word used is 
					clemency, indicating that there may be something to be pardoned, to be forgiven; even when dealing with undeniable faults, "the law of clemency" is observed by this Valiant Woman.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is one act of mercy and compassion which it is in the power of every one of us to practice, and which gives very special joy to Our Most Merciful Mother, and that is, to help the 
					poor suffering souls in Purgatory. Our Lady once said to St. Bridget: "I am the Mother of all the souls in Purgatory, for all the pains that they have deserved for their sins are every 
					hour in some way mitigated by my prayers." There is perhaps no offering we can make which will be more pleasing to Her than prayers and acts of self-denial for the relief of the souls 
					She most specially desires to help. There is nothing She desires so much as to bring these poor souls out of their prison of suffering, and present them to Our Lord, and by our prayers 
					and sufferings we can help Her to do this.
				</p>
				<p>
					By sympathy, by feeling for the sorrows of others, by pity for all poor and suffering people, by kindness to the poor, and above all, by readiness to forgive and excuse those who have 
					injured or hurt us, we shall most especially honor Our Mother, the Virgin Most Merciful.
