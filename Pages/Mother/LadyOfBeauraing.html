					On the evening of November 29, 1932, five children, fun-loving, mischievous playmates, ranging from the fifteen to nine years of age, were walking toward the 
					railway viaduct in the Vallon part of Belgium, in the simple and quiet village of Beauraing. Suddenly one of them exclaimed that there was a bright light moving 
					at the viaduct. First they thought these the lights of a moving car. Very soon, however, they discovered the figure of a lady, and they instantly recognized that 
					this could be nothing less than the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Beauraing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nobody wished to believe what the children related. But the next evening they came home with the same story. The village laughed at them and their parents were 
					angry. The next time the children related with more details that they had seen a lady who was more beautiful than her statues, dressed in pure white, with a 
					crown of golden rays on her head.
				</p>
				<p>
					On December 2nd the children asked the lady some questions; she, smiling, confirmed that she was the Immaculate Virgin and demanded they "always be good." As the 
					vision continued, more people came to Beauraing, including police officials, doctors and psychologists.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were thirty-three apparitions in all. On December 29th the children related, the Blessed Virgin revealed on her breast a heart of gold. The next evening 
					she asked for more prayers. On January 1, 1933, Our Lady of Beauraing reiterated this request and told Fernande, the fifteen year old girl:
				</p>
				<p>
					"If you love my Son and love me, then sacrifice yourself for me."
				</p>
				<p>
					The Belgian bishops at the beginning forbade any processions or cults and started an investigation that was to last for ten years, during which serious 
					objections were brought against the children. Finally, in 1943, a decree was issued by the Bishop of Namur authorizing the cult of Our Lady of Beauraing.
				</p>
				<p>
					On July 18, 1947, Msgr. Charue personally received papal blessings for the Sanctuary dedicated to Our Lady of Beauraing  -  the Virgin of the Golden Heart. This 
					devotion has since taken on new and ever increasing proportions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The final approbation was given on July 2, 1949. The cures of Miss Van Laer and Mrs. Acar were declared miraculous by a decree given by Msgr. Charue. Many 
					conversions and graces have been obtained through the intercession of Our Lady of Beauraing. The editor of the Belgian Communist paper, "Le Drapeau Rouge" (the 
					Red Flag), was one of the first to become Catholic at the Shrine of Our Lady of Beauraing.
