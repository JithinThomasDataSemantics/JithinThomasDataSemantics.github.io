					Known now as Notre-Dame-des-Vertus, this is the 14th century church in Aubervilliers that is the very location that experienced so many miracles during the Middle Ages. As noted by the 
					Abbot Orsini, the church was originally dedicated to Saint Christopher, yet the name soon changed to honor the Mother of God in recognition of the graces and miracles obtained there due 
					to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

					The first miracle occurred on May 14th, 1336, known locally at the Miracle of Rain. It was during a time of terrible drought when a small girl entered the church of Saint Christopher 
					with flowers to adorn the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. While praying that Our Lady would send rain to save the crops, the girl suddenly noticed that the statue became covered with 
					what appeared to be drops of sweat and the sky turned dark as the weather turned to rain.

					The inhabitants of the parish flocked to the church, alerted by the sound of the church bell, to see the wonder and give thanks to God for this miracle. This was but the beginning of 
					the pilgrimages to the church that began almost immediately, especially from the parishes of Paris. These pilgrimages were encouraged by the authorities of the Church, as well as by the 
					example of the many distinguished visitors and the continued occurrences of many other miracles over the following centuries. These miracles included many cures and healings, as well as 
					the miracles of two children who were brought back to life. Kings and queen were among the many pilgrims who came during the Middle Ages, including King Louis XIII, who came to pray for 
					the capture of Rochelle.

					The Archbishop of Paris confirmed the celebration of the festival on the second Tuesday of May, which is the month of Mary. The small sanctuary was later replaced by a more imposing 
					church whose construction began in the fifteenth century. Particularly remarkable are the stained glass windows that adorn the church and remind the visitor of the extraordinary history 
					of this place. The miraculous wooden statue of Our Lady of Power was desecrated and burned on October 12, 1793, during the ravages of the French Revolution.
