					The Litany of the Blessed Virgin--also called the Litany of Loreto-- is one of the many Marian litanies, or praises of Blessed Virgin Mary, composed during the Middle Ages. The place of 
					honor it now holds, in the life of the Church, is due its faithful use at the shrine of the Holy House at Loreto, which, according to tradition, was the small cottage-like home where 
					the Holy Family had lived and which was miraculously transported by angels, in 1291, from the Holy Land to its present location in Loreto. It was definitely recommended by Pope Clement 
					VII and approved by Sixtus V in 1587, and all other Marian litanies were suppressed, at least for public use. Its forty-nine titles (fifty, or fifty-one, or even more, in some versions: 
					which are included on the Vatican website version) and invocations set before us Mother Mary's exalted privileges, her holiness of life, her amiability and power, her motherly spirit 
					and queenly majesty. Reflection on the titles of the litany, therefore, will unfold before us a magnificent picture of our heavenly Mother, even though we know little about her life.

					Our Lady's influence on the world has always been great. From the moment she took all of us as her spiritual children at the foot of the Cross, she has proved herself to be a mother 
					without equal. Over the course of time, she has lightened the burden of millions, brought peace and joy to tortured hearts, counsel to those in doubt, comfort to the sorrowing, 
					repentance and mercy to sinners, and God to everyone who would accept Him. Our Lady never ceases to work for the conversion, sanctification and salvation of us poor sinners. It was 
					during her apparition at La Salette, in 1846, that she said that we could never repay her for all that she has done for us. What a tremendous work she has been doing for God ever since 
					she came into being! Think of the multitude of sinners and Christians who this day will turn to Mary for help--and not one will turn away unassisted! Think of the multitude, in both 
					Heaven and Purgatory, who owe their salvation to the merciful intercession of the Mother of God!

				<b>What is a Litany?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					A litany is a prayer--a raising of the mind and heart heavenwards. It is a well-known and much appreciated form of responsive petition, used in public liturgical services, and in 
					private devotions, for common necessities of the Church, or in calamities -- to implore God's aid or to appease His just wrath. This form of prayer finds its model in Psalm 135: At 
					Rome the Litany of Loreto was introduced into the Basilica of S. Maria Maggiore by Cardinal Francesco Toledo in 1597; and Paul V, in 1613, ordered it to be sung in that church, morning 
					and evening, on Saturdays and on vigils and feasts of the Madonna. As a result of this example the Loreto Litany began to be used, and is still largely used, in all the churches of Rome.
