				<p><b>Prayer</b></p>
				<p><i>
				Hail Holy Queen, Mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To you do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this 
				valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy towards us; and after this our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of 
				your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.</i>

				<p>
				The Hail, Holy Queen (known as the "Salve Regina" in the original Latin) is one of the most well-known prayers about Mary. It is a prayer of petition, asking Mary for her prayers on our 
				behalf. Various sources place its origins in the eleventh or twelfth century. In medieval times, monks and friars sang it at the end of the day, and it is currently one of the four 
				prayers to Mary that make up a part of the Divine Office (the official prayers of the Church that are prayed at certain times of the day). The Hail, Holy Queen is also prayed at the 
				conclusion of the rosary.
				</p>
				<p>
				Although crowned Queen of Heaven (as shown above) Mary is by no means haughty, given such a title! She's a queen who wonderfully blends her majesty with her humility in her desire to be 
				of service to us. She wants to dispense God's graces through prayers such the Hail Holy Queen, the Memorare, and the Rosary.
				</p>
				<p>
				She wants to help us in asking for God's forgiveness for our sins. And, contrary to a sad misconception, Mary was never meant to replace her Divine Son as the focus of our worship. She 
				herself acknowledged, in Luke's Gospel (Lk 1:46), that her soul magnifies the Lord. She's always ready to point us in His direction on our path towards Eternal Life.
				</p>
				<p>
				God has given her all His graces for us. They come from God through Mary. All we need to do is ask for them with a humble, loving, and contrite heart.
				</p>
				<p>
				And, speaking of hearts, as Thomas Ã  Kempis, author of the spiritual classic The Imitation of Christ once said, "What safer refuge can we ever find than the compassionate heart of Mary?"
				</p>
				<p>
				A well-known hymn calls the Blessed Mother "the Queen who decks her subjects with the light of God's own grace." As mentioned earlier, many saints and other religious have stated 
				through the centuries that since God gave Mary all of His graces to give us as needed, she plays a key part in our salvation.
				</p>
				<p>
				As St. Antonius put it "Whoever asks and expects to obtain graces without the intercession of Mary endeavors to fly without wings."
				</p>
				<p>
				One can relate to the lines about our exile in the Hail Holy Queen fairly easily: When our first parents, Adam and Eve, were banished from the Garden of Eden, from Paradise in one with 
				God (because of Original Sin), we were as well. And how many times do we find ourselves, one way or another thinking of our lives with "sighs, mourning and weeping"?
				</p>
				<p>
				When we read of Mary's "eyes of mercy" (as "the mother of mercy") this point comes to mind: Mary once told St. Bridget that she was the mother not only of the just and the innocent but 
				also of sinners provided they were willing to repent.
				</p>
				<p>
				If they come to her with the intent of making amends she is indeed, as St. Catherine of Siena once referred to her, the dispenser of Divine Mercy!
				</p>
				<p>
				We can take comfort in knowing that if we pray to her with a sincere and contrite heart she in turn will pray to her Son for us. And her prayers are especially dear to Him. As St. 
				Bernard said "Her requests can never be refused."
				</p>
				<p>
				Ultimately the Blessed Mother wants to help us fill a void in our lives through finding the peace that only Jesus, the fruit of her womb, (as Mary's cousin Elizabeth referred to Him in 
				Luke 1:42) can give us. This can go a long way in bringing us back from "our exile" into a deeper union with our Creator.
				</p>
				<p>
				Nonetheless, she cannot force God's graces on us. We must be receptive to them through prayer and through our sincere efforts to live according to His will for us.
				</p>
				<p>
				If we pray the Hail Holy Queen in the Rosary daily, and other such prayers of devotion to our Blessed Mother, she will give us the graces we need to live our lives to be "worthy of the 
				promises of Christ!"
