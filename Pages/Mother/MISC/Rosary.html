					1.The rosary probably began as a practice by the laity to imitate the monastic Divine Office (Breviary or Liturgy of the Hours), during the course of which the monks daily prayed the 
					150 Psalms. The laity, many of whom could not read, substituted 50, or even 150, Ave Marias (Hail Marys) for the Psalms. This prayer, at least the first half of it so directly 
					biblically, seems to date from as early as the 2nd century, as ancient graffiti at Christian sites has suggested. Sometimes a cord with knots on it was used to keep an accurate count of 
					the Aves.
				</p>
				<p>
					2.The first clear historical reference to the rosary, however, is from the life of St. Dominic (died in 1221), the founder of the Order of Preachers or Dominicans. He preached a form of 
					the rosary in France at the time that the Albigensian heresy was devastating the Faith there. Tradition has it that the Blessed Mother herself asked for the practice as an antidote for 
					heresy and sin.
				</p>
				<p>
					3.One of Dominic's future disciples, Alain de Roche, began to establish Rosary Confraternities to promote the praying of the rosary. The form of the rosary we have today is believed to 
					have dated from his time. Over the centuries the saints and Popes have highly recommended the rosary, the greatest prayer in the Church after the Mass and Liturgy of the Hours. Not 
					surprisingly, its most active promoters have been Dominicans.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.Many similar prayer practices exist in other Christian communities, each with its own set of prescribed prayers and its own form of prayer beads, such as the prayer rope in Eastern 
					Orthodox Christianity. These devotions and their associated beads are usually referred to as "chaplets."
				</p>
				<p>
					5.The rosary is sometimes used by other Christians, especially by Lutherans, Anglicans and members of the Old Catholic Church. Other Protestants, however, such as Baptists and 
					Presbyterians, do not use it and actively discourage their congregants from using this method of prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					6.From the 16th to the early 20th century, the structure of the rosary remained essentially unchanged.  There were 15 mysteries, one for each of the 15 decades. In the 20th century the 
					addition of the Fatima Prayer to the end of each decade became popular. There were no other changes until 2002 when John Paul II instituted five optional new Luminous Mysteries.
				</p>

					7.Rosary means a 'crown of roses', a spiritual bouquet given to the Blessed Mother. It is sometimes called the Dominican Rosary, to distinguish it from other rosary-like prayers (e.g. 
					the Franciscan Rosary of the Seven Joys or Franciscan Crown, the Servite Rosary of the Seven Sorrows). It is also, in a general sense, a form of chaplet or corona (crown), of which 
					there are many varieties in the Church. Finally, in English it has been called 'Our Lady's Psalter' or 'the beads'. This last derives from an Old English word for prayers (bede) and to 
					request or pray (biddan or bid).  (I have a site on the blogroll called 'Waak en Bid', which in Afrikaans means 'Watch and Pray'.)
				</p>
				<p>
					8.The Rosary has been called the preparation for contemplation and the prayer of saints. While the hands and lips are occupied with the prayers (it can and should be prayed silently 
					when necessary so as not to disturb others), the mind meditates on the mysteries of the Incarnation and Redemption represented by the decades.
				</p>
				<p>
					9.The Rosary is traditionally dedicated to one of three sets of Mysteries to be said in sequence, one per day: the Joyful (Joyous) Mysteries; the Sorrowful Mysteries; and the Glorious 
					Mysteries. Each of these three sets of Mysteries has within it five different themes to be meditated upon, one for each decade of ten Hail Marys.
				</p>
				<p>
					10. Instructions for a five-decade Rosary: At the crucifix, make the Sign of Cross and say the Apostle's Creed. At the first bead, say an Our Father . At the section 
					of 3 beads, say 3 Hail Marys. The next bead represents another Our Father. At the Centerpiece, say a Glory Be, an Our Father and recite the respective Mystery (starting with [the first] 
					- see sections 11 through 13).  For each of the 10 beads, say a Hail Mary. At each single bead, say a Glory Be and an Our Father then state the next Mystery. Go around the circle five 
					times, finishing with 10 Hail Marys, to complete the 15 Mysteries. 
				</p>
				<p>
					14. Old, pre-Vatican II missals provide guidance, prayers and meditation for the aforementioned mysteries.  They are useful reading prior to praying the Rosary.
