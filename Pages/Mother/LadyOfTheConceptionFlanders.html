					Donay, now known as Douai in France, was once considered a thriving and populous region of Flanders during the Middle Ages, markedly famous for its textile market. It is now a commune 
					in northern France located on the Scarpe River 25 kilometers from Arras. The town of Douai is also known as Douay or Doway in the English language.
				</p>
				<p>
					The county of Flanders became part of the domain of the Duke of Burgundy in the year 1384, and then in 1477 became a possession of the Habsburg's. The town was taken by the French army 
					and became a permanent part of France in the year 1668.
				</p>
				<p>
					The University of Douai was founded in 1562. There was a Benedictine priory founded at Douai in 1605. In the year 1609 a translation of the Old Testament was published there and 
					combined with the recently published New Testament from Rheims to create the famous Douay-Rheims Bible that is still considered to be the standard for the complete Catholic Bible.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is certain that the French Revolution played a great deal of havoc in the region, and the town was heavily damaged during both World Wars.

					In Butler's lives of the Saints, there is a reference to a John Woodcock, OFM, born in 1603. According to this history, he joined the English Franciscans at Douai and was clothed there 
					in 1631. For some time he lived as a chaplain and confessor, and became a zealous worker on the English mission for many years but suffered from continual sickness and eventually 
					retired to the convent at Douai. This is the only reference I could find to the existence of a Capuchin Convent at Donay at the time.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is also mention of a Capuchin Monastery in the list of historical monuments of Douai, but other than the above, I can find no other information about this feast.
