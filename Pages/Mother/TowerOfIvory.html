					In Sacred Scripture we have the text in the Canticle of Canticles, "Thy neck is as a tower of ivory," which probably suggested this title of Our Lady.
				</p>
				<p>
					We read in the 9th chapter of the Second Book of Paralipomenon of a great throne of ivory, overlaid with pure gold: "there was not such a throne in any kingdom." And a little later on 
					in the same chapter we are told how the king's ships went to Tharsis every three years with the servants of Hiram, king of Tyre, and brought thence gold, silver, and ivory. So that some 
					rich person of those lands might, if he pleased, have a tower overlaid with plates of ivory.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we say "Tower of Ivory," the very words call up in our minds a glowing image of delicate beauty, a celestial structure with pinnacles and spires of dazzling whiteness, resplendent 
					in the sunlight, lovely in shape as well as in substance, a very picture of elegance and stainlessness, a truly appropriate image of the Most Pure Virgin Mary. Its dazzling whiteness 
					suggests to us the spotlessness of Her soul. As the ivory tower was for the king or owner of the vineyard in which it was built - a place of pleasure and delight, so was Mary's soul to 
					Jesus.
				</p>
				<p>
					We too must strive to make our souls such that Jesus will find in them a place of pleasure and repose. There, by the purity of our souls, may His eyes be soothed and refreshed in His 
					disappointments. To a Saint Our Lord once said: "My child, I am weary and sorrowful with the sins and ingratitude of men; open to Me the dwelling of thy heart, that I may find a little 
					rest with thee." The soul of that Saint must in some way have resembled Mary's, the Tower of Ivory; it must have been pure, calm, peaceful, and lovely. In the same way, if we strive to 
					keep our souls calm, free from restless desires and turbulent passions, Our Lord will be able to come and take His pleasure in us, as the king of olden times did in his ivory tower. 
					"His place is in peace."
				</p>
				<p>
					And we, too, need a tower of refuge in our troubles and difficulties, a place where we can hide from the attacks of our passions. At those times we may think of Mary as the beautiful, 
					graceful, pure, peaceful Tower of Ivory, opening to us its gates, ever ready to receive us and soothe us back to peace and calm of soul. Fly to Her, ask Her to shield you from the hot 
					blasts of passion, to restore the calm, the peace, the serenity of your soul that you, too, may grow into a lovely tower of ivory for Our King and Lord.
				</p>
				<p>
					The whiteness of ivory is, of course, the emblem of purity, and reminds us by contrast, how shameful and degrading is the opposite vice. Let us pray to Mary, the Tower of Ivory, that we 
					may ever prize the purity and spotlessness of our souls above all things, and that She may preserve us from all sin, especially grievous sin, so that Our Lord may always find in us a 
					choice dwelling-place.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are told that Our Lord said of St. Gertrude: "You shall find Me in the heart of Gertrude." And every year in the Office of her feast, these words are chanted: "In the heart of 
					Gertrude you shall find Me, My soul hath delighted in her." She was a true copy of Mary, the Tower of Ivory. But Jesus will not find in us a peaceful dwelling, if our souls are full of 
					passionate desires, troubled, turbulent, and like a lake in a storm  -  for "His place is in peace." "The Lord is not in the whirlwind," that is, "non in commotione Dominus"  -  not in 
					anything that is in agitation
