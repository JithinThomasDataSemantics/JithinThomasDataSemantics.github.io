					This image, which is under the portal of the lower Holy Chapel, has wrought many miracles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Saint King Louis IX, on his return from the Holy Land, built at Paris the so-called Holy Chapel (Sainte-Chapelle) in honor of Mary. In it he placed the relics of Our Lord's Passion 
					which he brought with him from the Sacred Places in Palestine. Completed in the year 1248, it is a marvel of Flamboyant Gothic architecture. The structure itself seems but a delicate 
					framework for the incredible stained glass windows. Even though the chapel was seriously damaged during the ravages of the French Revolution, most of the stained glass is original and 
					the rest restored to its original condition.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the door of the chapel stands a graceful statue of Mary. At the feet of this statue the doctors and literati of the day loved to prostrate themselves and their works.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary had not yet been declared, many believed in it, and prelates preached it from the pulpits. John Dons Scotus, one of the most 
					prominent theologians of the Middle Ages, was among those who believed in the Immaculate Conception, and he very ardently argued in her favor. He was beatified in the year 1993 by Pope 
					John Paul II. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One day as Dons Scotus knelt before Mary's image preparing to champion her sinlessness against the antagonists, he asked her to bend her head forward if she were pleased with his 
					efforts. The image of Mary inclined her head, and from that very moment the head of the image remained inclined.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon witnessing this miracle, the faithful championed the cause of Mary's Immaculate Conception, praying to her under the title and receiving answers to petitions, special graces and 
					miracles.
				</p>
				<p>
					The statue survived the French Revolution, and is currently on display in the Louvre Museum in Paris, which describes it as "unquestionably the most beautiful piece of ronde-bosse (in 
					the round) ivory carving ever made," just as She is the most beautiful creature ever to have been created by God.
