					The town of Abbeville is a commune located in the Somme department in Picardy in the northern region of France. It is located on the Somme River. There appear to 
					be four Catholic churches in Abbeville at the present time  -  Saint Wulfran, St Sepulcre, Saint James, and Brunel.
				</p>
				<p>
					The church of Saint Wulfram has already been written about, and November 2nd is the date for it on the Marian Calendar. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher is a 
					Gothic style church from the 11th century. The church of Saint James is another Gothic church, but a storm in 2005 brought down part of the steeple that pierced 
					the roof of the nave, and the state of the church is deteriorating quickly. It is in such poor condition that it is threatened with demolition. Of the last 
					church, Brunel, I can find only a photograph of a Gothic style church and an address in Abbeville. None of these churches seem to be what Abbot Orsini was 
					referring to. It is possible, and perhaps even likely, that the church no longer exists, thanks to the French Revolution. If anyone has any information about it, 
					please feel free to add your information to this page.

					"My dear Son, as the Lord of virtues and graces, exalted and adorned me with them from the first moment of my Immaculate Conception. And as, more-over, the 
					hindrance of sin touched me not, I was free from the impediments which prevented other mortals from entering into the eternal gates of heaven; on the contrary 
					the powerful arm of my Son acted with me as being the Mistress of all virtues and as the Queen of heaven. Because He was to vest Himself and assume unto Himself 
					human nature from my flesh and blood, He was beforehand in preparing me and making me like Himself in purity and exemption from fault and in other divine gifts 
					and privileges. As I was not a slave of sin, I exercised the virtues not as a subject, but as a Mistress, without contradiction, but with sovereignty, not like 
					the children of Adam, but like the Son of God, who was also my Son."
