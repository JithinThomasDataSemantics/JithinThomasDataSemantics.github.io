					Our Lady of Grace is one of the most ancient maritime chapels of Normandy. This sanctuary was built in consequence of a vow made, in a great tempest, by a Norman 
					duke, who was very devout to the Blessed Virgin. The site of this handsome chapel, surrounded by large trees, in the midst of turf enameled with flowers, is 
					beautiful and calm, like the rich and fresh landscapes of the magnificent province of which it forms a part.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Lady of Grace appears like the fortress of Honfleur; from the little mountain which it crowns, the mouth of the Seine is visible, and farther on the ocean, 
					with its long waves of dark green, which receives in its bosom the river of blue waters. Two roads lead to the chapel: the one rough and rocky, the other smooth 
					and even. In other times the inhabitants of Honfleur took delight in pointing out Our Lady of Grace, in reducing its steepness, in covering it with small, fine 
					sand, so that a gracious princess, who had made herself beloved in these parts by her generous bounty, might be able to ascend it without fatigue, when she went 
					to offer her prayers and vows to the Blessed Virgin.
				</p>
				<p>
					The hurricane of revolutions has carried off the noble lady to a distance, as the wind bears away a rose leaf; but the remembrance of her beneficence still 
					subsists.
