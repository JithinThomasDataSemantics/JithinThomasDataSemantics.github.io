					Blessed Angela of Foligno was born in 1248 of a prominent family in Foligno, three leagues from Assisi. As a young woman, and also as a wife and mother, she lived only for the world and 
					its vain pleasures. But the grace of God intended to make of her a vessel of election for the comfort and salvation of many. A ray of the divine mercy touched her soul and so strongly 
					affected her as to bring about a conversion.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the command of her confessor, Blessed Angela of Foligno committed to writing the manner of her conversion in eighteen spiritual steps.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Enlightened by grace," Blessed Angela of Foligno wrote in this account. "I realized my sinfulness; I was seized with a great fear of being damned, and I shed a flood of tears. I went 
					to confession to be relieved of my sins, but through shame I concealed the most grievous ones, but still I went to Communion. Now my conscience tortured me day and night. I called upon 
					St. Francis for help, and, moved by an inner impulse, I went into a church where a Franciscan Father was then preaching. It is reported that in the year 1285 she had a vision of both 
					the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Francis of Assisi, who called her to penance.
				</p>
				<p>
					"I gathered courage to confess all my sins to him, and I did this immediately after the sermon. With zeal and perseverance I performed the penance he imposed, but my heart continued to 
					be full of bitterness and shame. I recognized that the divine mercy has saved me from hell, hence I resolved to do rigorous penance; nothing seemed too difficult for me, because I felt 
					I belonged in hell. I called upon the saints, and especially upon the Blessed Virgin, to intercede with God for me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mary appears to Angela of Foligno, cont:
				</p>
				<p>
					"It appeared to me now as if they had compassion on me, and I felt the fire of divine love enkindled within me so that I could pray as I never prayed before. I had also received a 
					special grace to contemplate the cross in which Christ had suffered so much for my sins. Sorrow, love, and the desire to sacrifice everything for Him filled my soul."
				</p>
				<p>
					About this time God harkened to the earnest desire of the penitent: her mother died, then her husband, and soon afterwards all her children. These tragic events were very painful to 
					her; but she made the sacrifice with resignation to the will of God. Being freed from these ties, she dispossessed herself of all her temporal goods with the consent of her confessor, a 
					Franciscan friar named Arnoldo, so that being poor herself, she might walk in the footsteps of her poor Savior. It was to Arnoldo what she dictated her account of her conversion, now 
					known as the 'Memoriale,' or the 'Book of Visions and Instructions.'
				</p>
				<p>
					She also entered the Third Order of St. Francis, and presently found herself the superior and guide of others who followed in her path. Many women joined her, even to the point of 
					taking the three vows. She encouraged them in works of charity, in nursing the sick, and in going personally from door to door to beg for the needs of the poor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, Angela became still more immersed in the contemplation of the Passion of Christ, and she chose the Sorrowful Mother and the faithful disciple John as her patrons. The sight 
					of the wounds which her Lord suffered for her sins urged her to the practice of still greater austerities. Once Our Lord showed her that His Heart is a safe refuge in all the storms of 
					life. She was soon to be in need of such a refuge. God permitted her to be afflicted with severe temptations. The most horrible and loathsome representations distressed her soul.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fire of concupiscence raged so furiously that she said:
				</p>
				<p>
					"I would rather have beheld myself surrounded with flames and permitted myself to be continually roasted that to endure such things."
				</p>
				<p>
					Still, she called out to God,
				</p>
				<p>
					"Glory be to Thee, O Lord! Thy cross is my resting place."
				</p>
				<p>
					These painful trials lasted over two years; but then the purified and tried servant of the Lord was filled with great consolation. She obtained a marvelous insight into divine things 
					and was very frequently found in ecstasy. For a time she had the stigmata, and for many years Holy Communion was her only food, until at last, completely purified, she entered into the 
					eternal joy of the Supreme Good on January 4, 1310.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pope Innocent XII approved the continual devotion paid to her at her tomb in Foligno, where many miracles were attributed to her. He beatified her in 1693.
				</p>
				<p>
					Blessed Angela of Foligno said,
				</p>
				<p>
					"To know oneself and to know God, that is the perfection of man; without this knowledge, visions and the greatest gifts are of no account."
