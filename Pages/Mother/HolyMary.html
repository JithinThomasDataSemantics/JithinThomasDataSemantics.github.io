					To call someone holy is not reserved alone to God. Holy means SET APART. Cities are called holy, places are called holy, mountains are called holy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mary was most certainly set apart by God. She was the one women in all of history who was set aside to give a Human nature to God, and to clothe divinity with flesh in her womb.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore it is both good and right to call Mary Holy.
