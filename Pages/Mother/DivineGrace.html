					"With me are riches and glory, that I may enrich them that love me." These words of Holy Writ are applied to Our Lady, because in her hands are all the riches of 
					Divine Grace, to distribute to the souls that need them. Even before she became the Mother of Him who is the Source and Fountain of all grace, the Angel saluted 
					her as "full of grace."
				</p>
				<p>
					How is this? The Saints and Doctors of the Church tell us that she was "plena sibi," full of grace for her own perfection and sanctification, that she might be a 
					worthy tabernacle for the Most High, but by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost, she became "superplena nobis," filled to overflowing for our sake, for it was 
					she who was to bring to us Jesus, the Author and Source of all grace.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Saints call her "the treasurer of divine grace." St. Bonaventure says that she is the field mentioned in the Gospel in which was hid the great Treasure, for 
					in her was hidden Jesus Christ, who is the Treasure of God the Father.
				</p>
				<p>
					And she herself tells us, in the words of Holy Writ applied to her in the Divine Office, "In me is all grace of the Way and of the Truth," that is, all the grace 
					of Jesus, her Son, who is "the Way and the Truth."
				</p>
				<p>
					Observe what happens as soon as Mary receives within her Jesus, the Source of grace. Her very first thought is to bring her grace to others, that they may share 
					in it. She sets out without a moment's delay on the long and toilsome journey to her cousin Elizabeth. "She went with haste" and the Gospel tells us that the 
					moment she entered her cousin's dwelling Elizabeth was "filled with the Holy Ghost," that is, with grace.
				</p>
				<p>
					St. John, the little unborn babe of Elizabeth, was instantly cleansed from original sin and sanctified, and showed the grace he had received through Mary, by 
					leaping in his mother's womb. We see by this that the very graces which Our Lord is known to have given on earth, after His Incarnation, were given through Mary. 
					Elizabeth says: "Whence is this to me that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?" showing that she recognized Mary as the Mother of divine grace. It is, of 
					course, Our Lord who gives all grace, but through Mary. 
				</p>
				<p>
					St. Bernardine of Siena says: "From the time when Mary conceived the Incarnate Word, she received from God the privilege, that no one should receive any grace 
					otherwise than through her hands."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Fear not," said the Angel, "thou hast found grace." Through her, the blessed finder of grace, all we who have lost grace are also to find it.But though Mary is 
					as eager to pour out graces upon us, as she was to bring them to Elizabeth and her household, we also have to do our part.
				</p>
				<p>
					It seems to be a universal law in every sphere that "nothing is to be had for nothing," that there is some price, no matter how small, to be paid for every good 
					thing. To have flowers, you must sew seed; to have fruit, you must plant fruit-trees; to be skillful in an art or trade, a good painter, a good musician, a good 
					architect, a good doctor, you must study and practice your profession. So also is it in the Kingdom of Christ.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Gospel, you may observe that, in most of the miracles Our Lord worked, He required some little thing to be done: either the miracle was to be prayed for, 
					as in the case of the ruler's son, or the Canaanite woman's daughter, or the cure of the blind man; or He gave them some small act to do, as for instance, to 
					fill the water-pots with water, before the miraculous wine was given, at the marriage feast of Cana. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The thing that we have to do, in order to gain grace, is to pray, to pray, above all, to Mary, the Mother of Divine Grace. "Let us seek grace," says St. Bernard, 
					"but seek it through Mary." This does not mean that we are not to ask Our Lord for whatever we need; He is always the Giver of Graces, but it is His will to give 
					them through Mary.
				</p>
				<p>
					"With me are riches and glory," says Holy Writ. The supernatural riches of grace are to be had for the asking. Eternal glory is but grace transfigured. What is 
					sanctifying grace in this life is in the next eternal glory. To be enriched by grace we have but to love and pray to Mary.
				</p>
				<p>
					At every Mass, the mysteries of the Incarnation and Visitation are renewed for us. Mary at Nazareth said but five little words, and Our Lord was made Man. The 
					priest says but five little words at Mass, and Jesus is there in the host, to be given to each one of us as food, just as once He came to Mary. Mary, the Mother 
					of Divine Grace, is present there as at the Annunciation. But when the mystery of the Visitation is renewed by Our Lord's visit to us in Holy Communion, she, the 
					Mother of Divine Grace, longs to help us to prepare our souls for Jesus, and is anxious that we should lose none of the blessings attached to these golden 
					moments. Think of her at Mass and Holy Communion. Ask her to adorn your souls for Jesus. Put all your communions under the protection of the Mother of Divine 
					Grace.
				</p>
				<p>
					When people go to draw water from a well, they can draw only as much as the vessel they bring with them can hold - a thimble will hold a thimbleful, a gallon 
					bucket a gallon. He who brings the largest vessel gets the most water. And it is the same with our souls in Holy Communion. Our Lord is the Fountain of all 
					grace. He has in Himself all grace. He is longing to give it away, to pour it into our souls.
				</p>
				<p>
					He gives to each as much as the soul's capacity can hold. If our soul is small and shallow, it can only hold a little grace.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it is by the fervor of the acts we make after Holy Communion that our capacity for grace is increased; every moment we make a fervent, heartfelt act, no 
					matter how simple, we increase as it were the size of our vessel and immediately Jesus fills it, for every act we make then is made in union with His Sacred 
					Heart, and is of infinite value. It is for us then, to beg the Mother of Divine Grace to help us to make our souls wider and deeper, so as to be able to hold all 
					the grace Our Lord is longing to pour into our souls.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we must beg of her above all, is to enable us to empty our souls of self and of creatures, for if a wineglass is full of water, and you attempt to pour wine 
					into it, the water will perhaps just be tinged with wine, but most of it will spill and not go into the glass. Just so, some of us only allow Our Lord to give 
					them the merest sprinkling of grace, because their souls are too full of self-love, self-esteem, and selfishness.
				</p>
				<p>
					But if Mary is asked to help us to remove the obstacles to grace she will certainly do so.
