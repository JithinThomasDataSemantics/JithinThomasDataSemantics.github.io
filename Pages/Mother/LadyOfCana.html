					(John 2:1-11) At that time there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there. And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the 
					marriage. And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him: They have no wine. And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is it to me and to thee? My hour is not 
					yet come. His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye. Now there were set there six water-pots of stone, according to the manner of 
					the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece. Jesus saith to them: Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And 
					Jesus saith to them: Draw out now, and carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it. And when the chief steward calleth the bridegroom, and saith 
					to him: Every man at first setteth forth good wine; and when men have well drank, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. This 
					beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee: and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

					Fr. Leonard Goffine explains: In order to honor this humble and God-fearing couple who, with faithful hearts, had invited Him and His mother to their wedding; to 
					give us an example of humility; to assist them in their poverty, and save their good name by changing water into wine; to reveal His dignity as the Messiah to 
					His disciples by this miracle; and to sanctify by His presence the marriages that are contracted in the spirit of the Church.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alas! How few marriages of our time could Jesus honor with His presence, because He is invited neither by fervent prayer, nor by the chaste life of the couple: 
					He is excluded rather, by the frequent immorality of the married couple of their guests.
				</p>

					Mary was interested in this couple because she is merciful, and the Mother of Mercy, and willingly assists all the poor and afflicted who fear God. From this 
					incident, St. Bonaventure judges of the many graces which we can hope for through Mary, now that she reigns in heaven; "For," says he, "if Mary while yet on 
					earth was so compassionate, how much more so is she now, reigning in heaven!" He gives the reason by adding: "Mary now that she sees the face of God, knows our 
					necessities far better than when she was on earth, and in proportion to the increase of her compassion, her power to aid us has been augmented." Ah! Why do we 
					not take refuge in all our necessities to this merciful mother, who although unasked assists the needly?
