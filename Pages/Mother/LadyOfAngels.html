					Our Lady of Angels, or of the Portiuncula, is located six hundred yards from the city of Assissium, in Italy. It was a desolate locality, and apparently an 
					unsettled one where robbers and the lawlessness flourished, for the Benedictines who had lived at the monastery felt it was too hazardous to remain there. They 
					abandoned the monastery, relocating to Mount Subasio, which was a fortified monastery.

					The original chapel is thought to date from the 4th Century, and was built by holy hermits who had come from the Valley of Josaphat. It is said that they brought 
					relics of the Blessed Virgin with them to the region when they constructed the chapel.

					When Saint Francis chanced to come upon the little, run down and abandoned chapel of Our Lady of Angels, or Santa Maria degli Angelis, in the year 1208, it was 
					almost completely hidden in shrubs and brush. Saint Francis entered the hidden church, which measured only twenty-two feet by thirteen feet, and saw the ancient 
					fresco that had been placed above the main altar. It was an image of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin surrounded by angels. Some say that this is why the 
					chapel was named Our Lady of Angels, although there are also legends that angels could often be heard singing there.

					The place took its name, the Little Portion, or Portiuncula in the native Italian, from the small section of fertile land that was gifted to the monks for them 
					to work for their support. It is said that this was the place where Saint Francis first understood his vocation, received visions, and was also where the saint 
					desired to live. The Benedictines had lived at that location for hundreds of years, but the Benedictine monks gave this chapel to Saint Francis upon his request. 
					It was certainly here that the Franciscan Order was founded.
				</p>
				<p>
					At first Saint Francis wished the convent which he built there to be the principal one of his order. He assembled the first General Chapter there, where there 
					were five thousand religious. It was also where he yielded up the ghost on October 3rd in the year 1226, the twentieth of his conversion, and the forty-fifth of 
					his age. The cell in which the poor man of Assisi died can still be seen where it rests against one of the columns of the cupola under the choir bay.
