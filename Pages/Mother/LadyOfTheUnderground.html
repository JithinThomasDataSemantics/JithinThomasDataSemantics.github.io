					Our Lady of the Underground, half a league from Grand Cairo. It is held by tradition that the Blessed Virgin lived for some years in this subterranean chapel.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Saint Joseph sought to purchase for a suitable price some dwelling in the neighborhood; and the Lord ordained that he should find a poor and humble, yet serviceable house, at small 
					distance from the city, just such as the Queen of heaven desired."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Having therefore found this dwelling near Heliopolis, they took their abode therein. At the first entrance of the heavenly Lady with her Divine Son and Saint Joseph, She prostrated 
					Herself to the ground, kissing it in profound humility and lovingly thanking the Most High for having secured them this place of rest after their prolonged and laborious journeying."
				</p>
				<p>
					"She adored the immutable being of God in this prostration, dedicating all that She was to do in this place to His honor and worship. Interiorly She made a sacrifice of all her powers 
					and faculties, offering to assume readily and with joy all the labors by which the Almighty could be served during her exile; for in her prudence She foresaw and affectionately embraced 
					them all. By means of her divine knowledge She set a great value on sufferings; understanding how highly they are esteemed at the divine tribunal, and how her most Holy Son looked upon 
					them as a rich treasure and inheritance."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Having performed these exalted acts of devotion, She set about humbly to clean and arrange the poor little house, borrowing the instruments for this purpose. Although our heavenly 
					strangers were thus sufficiently provided with the shelter of bare walls, they were in want of all else pertaining to the sustenance and comfort of daily life. As they now lived in an 
					inhabited country, the miraculous assistance, which they had enjoyed in the desert through the ministry of the angels, failed them; and the Lord left them to the last resource of the 
					poor, namely, the begging of alms. Having come to these straits of suffering hunger, Saint Joseph went forth to seek this kind of assistance for the love of God; giving thereby an 
					example to the poor not to complain of their affliction and, all other means failing, not to be ashamed to have recourse to this expedient. For so early the Lord of all creation allowed 
					Himself to fall into this extreme of being obliged to beg for his sustenance, in order that He might have an occasion to return the alms a hundredfold."
				</p>
				<p>
					"During the first three days of their arrival in Heliopolis, just as in other places of Egypt, the queen had for Herself and for her Onlybegotten no other sustenance than what was 
					begged by His foster father Saint Joseph. When he began to earn some wages by his work, he made a humble couch for the Mother and a cradle for her Son; while he himself had as a resting 
					place only the bare ground; for the house was without any furniture until by his own labor he succeeded in making some of the most indispensable pieces for the convenience of all three."
