					The devotion to this Marian advocation revolves around the picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour,  painted on wood, with background of gold. It is Byzantine 
					in style and is supposed to have been painted in the thirteenth century. It represents the Mother of God holding the Divine Child while the Archangels Michael 
					and Gabriel presenting  Him the instruments of His Passion. Over the figures in the picture are some Greek letters which form the abbreviated words Mother of 
					God, Jesus Christ, Archangel Michael, and Archangel Gabriel respectively.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The icon  was brought to Rome towards the end of the fifteenth century by a pious merchant, who, dying there, ordered by his will that the picture should be 
					exposed in a church for public veneration. It was exposed in the church of San Matteo in the famous Roman street of Via Merulana, which connects the basilicas of 
					Saint Mary Major and Saint John Lateran. Crowds flocked to this church, and for nearly three hundred years many graces were obtained through the intercession of 
					the Blessed Virgin. The picture was then popularly called the Madonna di San Matteo. The church was served for a time by the Hermits of Saint Augustine.
				</p>
				<p>	
					These Augustinians were still in charge when the French invaded Rome (1812) and destroyed the church. The picture disappeared; it remained hidden and neglected 
					for over forty years, but a series of providential circumstances between 1863 and 1865 led to its rediscovery in an oratory of the Augustinian Fathers at Santa 
					Maria in Posterula.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Pope Pius IX, who as a boy had prayed before the picture in San Matteo, became interested in the discovery. But at that time, the ruins of San Matteo were in the 
					grounds of  a convent of the Redemptorists -the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer-,  founded by St. Alphonsus Liguori  (1696-1787). 
				</p>
				<p>	
					The Father General of the Redemptorists, Most Rev. Nicholas Mauron, decided to bring the whole matter to the attention of the Pope.  The Pope listened 
					attentively and felt sure it was God's will that the icon should be gain exposed to public veneration and the logical site was their church of St. Alphonsus, 
					standing as it did between the Basilicas of St. Mary Major and St. John Lateran.  The Holy Father at once took a piece of paper and wrote a short memorandum 
					ordering the Augustinian Fathers of St. Mary in Posterula to surrender the picture to the Redemptorists, on condition that the Redemptorists supply the 
					Augustinians with another picture of Our Lady or a good copy of the icon of Perpetual Help.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The Icon meant much to the Augustinians, but when the two Redemptorists came armed with the Pope's signed memorandum, what could they do but obey?  On January 
					19, 1866, Fathers Marchi and Bresciani brought the miraculous picture to St. Alphonsus' church.  Preparations were now made to inaugurate the new public reign of 
					Our Lady of Perpetual Help. On April 26th, a great procession was staged in which the picture was carried throughout the Esquiline region of Rome.  Upon 
					returning to the church, the picture was enthroned over the high altar, in a resplendent shrine-niche especially constructed for it.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The report of  marvelous healings spread rapidly throughout the city of Rome and people came by the hundreds to visit the shrine.  Soon the whole area around the 
					altar was filled with abandoned crutches and canes and several whole glass-covered cabinets were filled with gold and silver thanksgiving offerings in the shapes 
					of miniature hearts, arms, legs and other votive offerings.  Scarcely two weeks after the solemn exposition of the picture, Pope Pius IX himself came to visit 
					the shrine.  He stood quietly before it for a long time and then exclaimed: “How beautiful she is!”.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Pope Leo XIII, the next pontiff, had a copy of the picture on his desk so that he might see it constantly during his working day.  St. Pius X sent a copy of the 
					icon to the Empress of Ethiopia and granted an indulgence of 100 days to anyone who repeated the phrase: “Mother of Perpetual Help, pray for us.”
				</p>
				<p>	
					Pope Benedict XV had the picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help placed immediately over his chair of state in the throne room.  Here it could be seen by all just 
					over his head, as if to say: “Here is your true Queen!”.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Pope Pius IX told the Redemptorists, in speaking to them of the treasure he had committed to their care: “Make her known!”  It seems as though they hardly needed 
					the exhortation.  In the United States, they built the first Our Lady of Perpetual Help church in the Roxbury section of Boston, and it was eventually raised to 
					the honor of a “Papal Basilica” by Pope Pius XII.
				</p>
				<p><strong><em>Symbolism of the icon of Perpetual Help</em></strong></p>
				<p>
					The influence of Eastern icons in the West, around the XII and XIII centuries brought a class of icons called Cardiotissa, from the Greek word kardia, meaning 
					heart.  Cardiotissa means “having a heart” or showing sympathy and mercy and compassion.  In them the face of Our Lady appears full of sorrow, yet supremely 
					dignified in her contemplation of the sufferings of her Son.  His passion is represented by angels holding instruments of His passion, most often the cross, the 
					lance, the sponge, and the nails.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The Our Mother of Perpetual Help icon is of this type. The angels holding the instruments of the Passion have their hands covered with a protecting veil as a 
					sign of reverence in handling sacred objects.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The Child Jesus is shown with an adult face and a high brow, indicating His divine Mind of infinite intelligence.  As God, He knew that the angelic apparition 
					was prophetic of His future passion.  Yet in His human nature as a small child, He is frightened and runs to His Mother for protection. Our Lady hastily picks 
					Him up and clasps Him to her bosom.  This action is indicated by the fact that the Lord's right foot is nervously curled about the left ankle and in such haste 
					that His right sandal has become loosened and hangs by a single strap.  Further action is indicated by the way the Child Jesus clasps His Mother's right hand 
					with both of His, holding tightly to Our Lady's thumb.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Our Lady is clothed in a dress of dark red which was long reserved in the Byzantine world for the Empress alone, indicating the Queenship of Mary.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Some commentators on color claim that bluish purple became the color of penance in the Western Church (during Lent and Advent) because purple is a combination of 
					blue and red.  The blue reminds us of heaven, to which we wish to arrive by our penance, and the red recalls martyrdom, because all penance requires a dying to 
					oneself, especially mortifying inordinate desire for food and pleasure.  The archangels Gabriel and Michael were tunics of purple since they carry the 
					instruments of the passion and death of Christ.  The figures of the icon are identified with abbreviations of their names and Mary is designated by her chief 
					title to glory: Mother of God.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Our Lady's face is of unspeakable majesty and calm and yet her large eyes, partly closed, express ineffable sorrow and sympathy.  Our Lady is not looking at 
					Jesus, but rather to us,  to express compassion for us in our fears and sorrows.
