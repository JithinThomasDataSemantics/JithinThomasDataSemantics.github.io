				"I will now tell you the whole truth; I will conceal nothing at all from you. I have already said to you, 'A king's secret it is prudent to keep, but the works of God are to be made 
				known with due honor.' I can now tell you that when you, Tobit, and Sarah prayed, it was I who presented and read the record of your prayer before the Glory of the Lord; and I did the 
				same thing when you used to bury the dead. When you did not hesitate to get up and leave your dinner in order to go and bury the dead, I was sent to put you to the test. At the same 
				time, however, God commissioned me to heal you and your daughter-in-law Sarah. I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who enter and serve before the Glory of the Lord." Tobit 12:11-15
				He spoke with them peacefully and swore to them, "We will not try to injure you or your friends." So they trusted him. But he arrested sixty of them and killed them in one day, 
				according to the text of Scripture: "The flesh of your saints they have strewn, and their blood they have shed round about Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them."

				When he had armed each of them, not so much with the safety of shield and spear as with the encouragement of noble words, he cheered them all by relating a dream, a kind of vision, 
				worthy of belief. What he saw was this: Onias, the former high priest, a good and virtuous man, modest in appearance, gentle in manners, distinguished in speech, and trained from 
				childhood in every virtuous practice, was praying with outstretched arms for the whole Jewish community. Then in the same way another man appeared, distinguished by his white hair and 
				dignity, and with an air about him of extraordinary, majestic authority. Onias then said of him, "This is God's prophet Jeremiah, who loves his brethren and fervently prays for his 
				people and their holy city." Stretching out his right hand, Jeremiah presented a gold sword to Judas. As he gave it to him he said, "Accept this holy sword as a gift from God; with it 
				you shall crush your adversaries."

				Then shall the just one with great assurance confront his oppressors who set at nought his labors. Seeing this, they shall be shaken with dreadful fear, and amazed at the unlooked-for 
				salvation. They shall say among themselves, rueful and groaning through anguish of spirit: "This is he whom once we held as a laughingstock and as a type for mockery, fools that we 
				were! His life we accounted madness, and his death dishonored. See how he is accounted among the sons of God; how his lot is with the saints!"

				"I say to you, many will come from the east and the west, and will recline with Abraham, Isaiahac, and Jacob at the banquet in the kingdom of heaven, but the children of the kingdom 
				will be driven out into the outer darkness, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth."  
				<br/>

					<em>--Mathew 8:11-12</em>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them; his face shone like the sun and his 
				clothes became white as light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with him. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Mathew 17:1-3</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				Jesus said to them in reply, "You are misled because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God. At the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like 
				the angels in heaven. And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaiahac, and the God of Jacob'? 
				He is not the God of the dead but of the living." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Mathew 22:29-32</em>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, and gave up his spirit. And behold, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, rocks were split, tombs 
				were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. And coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to 
				many. The centurion and the men with him who were keeping watch over Jesus feared greatly when they saw the earthquake and all that was happening, and they said, "Truly, this was the 
				Son of God!" 
				 <br/>

			<p id="pinkDiv">
				After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his clothes became dazzling white, such 
				as no fuller on earth could bleach them. Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus. Then Peter said to Jesus in reply, "Rabbi, it is good that 
				we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified. Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over 
				them; then from the cloud came a voice, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him." Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone but Jesus alone with them. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Mark 9:2-8</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				Jesus said to them, "Are you not misled because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God? When they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but 
				they are like the angels in heaven. As for the dead being raised, have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God told him, 'I am the God of Abraham, 
				(the) God of Isaiahac, and (the) God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead but of the living. You are greatly misled." 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Mark 12:24-27</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				About eight days after he said this, he took Peter, John, and James and went up the mountain to pray. While he was praying his face changed in appearance and his clothing became 
				dazzling white. And behold, two men were conversing with him, Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of his exodus that he was going to accomplish in Jerusalem. Peter and 
				his companions had been overcome by sleep, but becoming fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. As they were about to part from him, Peter said to Jesus, 
				"Master, it is good that we are here; let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." But he did not know what he was saying. While he was still speaking, a 
				cloud came and cast a shadow over them, and they became frightened when they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, "This is my chosen Son; listen to him." 
				After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They fell silent and did not at that time tell anyone what they had seen. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Luke 9:28-36</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it? And when he does find it, 
				he sets it on his shoulders with great joy and, upon his arrival home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them, 'Rejoice with me because I have found my lost 
				sheep.' I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance. Or what 
				woman having ten coins and losing one would not light a lamp and sweep the house, searching carefully until she finds it? And when she does find it, she calls together her friends and 
				neighbors and says to them, 'Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.' In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one 
				sinner who repents." 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Luke 15:4-10</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				Jesus said to them, "The children of this age marry and remarry; but those who are deemed worthy to attain to the coming age and to the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are 
				given in marriage. They can no longer die, for they are like angels; and they are the children of God because they are the ones who will rise. That the dead will rise even Moses made 
				known in the passage about the bush, when he called 'Lord' the God of Abraham, the God of Isaiahac, and the God of Jacob; and he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for to him 
				all are alive." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Luke 20:34-38</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				Peter thus was being kept in prison, but prayer by the church was fervently being made to God on his behalf. On the very night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter, secured 
				by double chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, while outside the door guards kept watch on the prison. Suddenly the angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shone in the cell. 
				He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, "Get up quickly." The chains fell from his wrists. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Acts 12:5-7</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				I urge you, (brothers,) by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in the struggle by your prayers to God on my behalf, that I may be delivered from the 
				disobedient in Judea, and that my ministry for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the holy ones, so that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and be refreshed together with you. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Romans 15:30-32</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				As a body is one though it has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body, so also Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews 
				or Greeks, slaves or free persons, and we were all given to drink of one Spirit. Now the body is not a single part, but many. If a foot should say, "Because I am not a hand I do not 
				belong to the body," it does not for this reason belong any less to the body. Or if an ear should say, "Because I am not an eye I do not belong to the body," it does not for this 
				reason belong any less to the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But as it is, God 
				placed the parts, each one of them, in the body as he intended. If they were all one part, where would the body be? But as it is, there are many parts, yet one body. The eye cannot 
				say to the hand, "I do not need you," nor again the head to the feet, "I do not need you." Indeed, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are all the more necessary, and those 
				parts of the body that we consider less honorable we surround with greater honor, and our less presentable parts are treated with greater propriety, whereas our more presentable parts 
				do not need this. But God has so constructed the body as to give greater honor to a part that is without it, so that there may be no division in the body, but that the parts may have 
				the same concern for one another. If (one) part suffers, all the parts suffer with it; if one part is honored, all the parts share its joy.

			<p id="pinkDiv">
				May the eyes of (your) hearts be enlightened, that you may know what is the hope that belongs to his call, what are the riches of glory in his inheritance among the holy ones, and 
				what is the surpassing greatness of his power for us who believe, in accord with the exercise of his great might, which he worked in Christ, raising him from the dead and seating him 
				at his right hand in the heavens, far above every principality, authority, power, and dominion, and every name that is named not only in this age but also in the one to come. And he 
				put all things beneath his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of the one who fills all things in every way.

				<strong>
					<em>--Ephesians 1:18-23</em>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the holy ones and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and 
				prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the capstone. Through him the whole structure is held together and grows into a temple sacred in the Lord; in him you also are being built 
				together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Ephesians 2:19-22</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that he may grant you in accord with the riches of his glory to be strengthened with 
				power through his Spirit in the inner self, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the 
				holy ones what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Ephesians 3:14-19</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				With all prayer and supplication, pray at every opportunity in the Spirit. To that end, be watchful with all perseverance and supplication for all the holy ones and also for me, that 
				speech may be given me to open my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in chains, so that I may have the courage to speak as I 
				must. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Ephesians 6:18-20</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				Therefore, from the day we heard this, we do not cease praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding 
				to live in a manner worthy of the Lord, so as to be fully pleasing, in every good work bearing fruit and growing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with every power, in accord with 
				his glorious might, for all endurance and patience, with joy giving thanks to the Father, who has made you fit to share in the inheritance of the holy ones in light. He delivered us 
				from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Colossians 1:9-14</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				What thanksgiving, then, can we render to God for you, for all the joy we feel on your account before our God? Night and day we pray beyond measure to see you in person and to remedy 
				the deficiencies of your faith. Now may God himself, our Father, and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you, and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and 
				for all, just as we have for you, so as to strengthen your hearts, to be blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones. 
				(Amen.)

				 <strong>
					 <em>--1 Thessalonians 3:9-13</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us rid ourselves of every burden and sin that clings to us and persevere in running the race that lies before 
				us while keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfecter of faith. For the sake of the joy that lay before him he endured the cross, despising its shame, and has taken his 
				seat at the right of the throne of God. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Hebrews 12:1-2</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				No, you have approached Mount Zion and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and countless angels in festal gathering, and the assembly of the firstborn enrolled in 
				heaven, and God the judge of all, and the spirits of the just made perfect, and Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and the sprinkled blood that speaks more eloquently than that of 
				Abel. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Hebrews 12:22-24</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				Then I saw standing in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures and the elders, a Lamb that seemed to have been slain. He had seven horns and seven eyes; these are the 
				(seven) spirits of God sent out into the whole world. He came and received the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat on the throne. When he took it, the four living creatures 
				and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each of the elders held a harp and gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the holy ones. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Revelation 5:6-8</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				When he broke open the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the witness they bore to the word of God. They cried out in a loud 
				voice, "How long will it be, holy and true master, before you sit in judgment and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?" Each of them was given a white robe, and they were 
				told to be patient a little while longer until the number was filled of their fellow servants and brothers who were going to be killed as they had been. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Revelation 6:9-11</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				After this I had a vision of a great multitude, which no one could count, from every nation, race, people, and tongue. They stood before the throne and before the Lamb, wearing white 
				robes and holding palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice: "Salvation comes from our God, who is seated on the throne, and from the Lamb." All the angels stood 
				around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They prostrated themselves before the throne, worshiped God, and exclaimed: "Amen. Blessing and glory, wisdom 
				and thanksgiving, honor, power, and might be to our God forever and ever. Amen." Then one of the elders spoke up and said to me, "Who are these wearing white robes, and where did they 
				come from?" I said to him, "My lord, you are the one who knows." He said to me, "These are the ones who have survived the time of great distress; they have washed their robes and made 
				them white in the blood of the Lamb. For this reason they stand before God's throne and worship him day and night in his temple. The one who sits on the throne will shelter them. They 
				will not hunger or thirst anymore, nor will the sun or any heat strike them. For the Lamb who is in the center of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of life-giving 
				water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Revelation 7:9-17</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a gold censer. He was given a great quantity of incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the holy ones, on the gold altar 
				that was before the throne. The smoke of the incense along with the prayers of the holy ones went up before God from the hand of the angel. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Revelation 8:3-4</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet. There were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Anointed, and he will reign forever and 
				ever." The twenty-four elders who sat on their thrones before God prostrated themselves and worshiped God and said: "We give thanks to you, Lord God almighty, who are and who were. 
				For you have assumed your great power and have established your reign. The nations raged, but your wrath has come, and the time for the dead to be judged, and to recompense your 
				servants, the prophets, and the holy ones and those who fear your name, the small and the great alike, and to destroy those who destroy the earth." Then God's temple in heaven was 
				opened, and the ark of his covenant could be seen in the temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a violent hailstorm. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Revelation 11:15-19</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				Then I looked and there was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. I heard 
				a sound from heaven like the sound of rushing water or a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. They were singing (what seemed to be) a 
				new hymn before the throne, before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn this hymn except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been ransomed from the 
				earth. These are they who were not defiled with women; they are virgins and these are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been ransomed as the firstfruits of the 
				human race for God and the Lamb. On their lips no deceit has been found; they are unblemished. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Revelation 14:1-5</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				Here is what sustains the holy ones who keep God's commandments and their faith in Jesus. I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from 
				now on." "Yes," said the Spirit, "let them find rest from their labors, for their works accompany them." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Revelation 14:12-13</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory. For the wedding day of the Lamb has come, his bride has made herself ready. She was allowed to wear a bright, clean linen garment." 
				(The linen represents the righteous deeds of the holy ones.) Then the angel said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who have been called to the wedding feast of the Lamb." And he 
				said to me, "These words are true; they come from God."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Revelation 19:7-9</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="pinkDiv">
				Then I saw thrones; those who sat on them were entrusted with judgment. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, and who 
				had not worshiped the beast or its image nor had accepted its mark on their foreheads or hands. They came to life and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the 
				dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection. The second death has no 
				power over these; they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for (the) thousand years.
