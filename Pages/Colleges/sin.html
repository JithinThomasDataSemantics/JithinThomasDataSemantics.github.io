				"There is no sin or wrong that gives a man a foretaste of hell in this life as anger and impatience."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Catherine of Sienna</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"The person who has surrendered himself entirely to sin indulges with enjoyment and pleasure in unnatural and shameful passions - 
				licentiousness, unchastity, greed, hatred, guile and other forms of vice - as though they were natural. The genuine and perfected Christian, 
				on the other hand, with great enjoyment and spiritual pleasure participates effortlessly and without impediment in all the virtues and all 
				the supranatural fruits of the Spirit - love, peace, patient endurance, faith, humility and the entire truly golden galaxy of virtue - as 
				though they were natural."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Symeon Metaphrastis</em>
				 </strong>

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"urge all souls to trust in the unfathomable abyss of My mercy, because I want to save them all. On the cross, the fountain of My mercy was 
				opened wide by the lance for all souls - no one have I excluded!"
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Faustina, Divine Mercy in my Soul</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Almost every sin is committed for the sake of sensual pleasure; and sensual pleasure is overcome by hardship and distress arising either 
				voluntarily from repentance, or else involuntarily as a result of some salutary and providential reversal. "For if we would judge ourselves, 
				we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, so that we should not be condemned with the world." (1 Cor. 
				11:31-32)."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Maximos the Confessor</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Indeed it is written, Everyone who sins is a slave of sin; but the slave does not abide in the house for ever. The son abides for ever. 
				Since then we too have been granted to have been called sons according to grace, we remain in the house for ever, if we hold firm the 
				beginning of our undertaking to the end."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Theodore the Studite</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Where sin was hatched, let tears now wash the nest."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Robert Southwell</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"We should all realize that no matter where or how a man dies, if he is in the state of mortal sin and does not repent, when he could have 
				done so and did not, the Devil tears his soul from his body with such anguish and distress that only a person who has experienced it can 
				appreciate it."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Francis of Assisi</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"We do not know the number of souls that is ours to save through our prayers and sacrifices; therefore, let us always pray for sinners."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Faustina, Divine Mercy in my Soul</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The Lord opened the understanding of my unbelieving heart, so that I should recall my sins."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Patrick</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Enjoy yourself as much as you like – if only you keep from sin."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint John Bosco</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Behold Jesus Christ crucified, Who is the only foundation of our hope; He is our Mediator and Advocate; the victim and sacrifice for our 
				sins. He is goodness and patience itself; His mercy is moved by the tears of sinners, and He never refuses pardon and grace to those who ask 
				it with a truly contrite and humbled heart."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Charles Borromeo</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
				
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Let us therefore give ourselves to God with a great desire to begin to live thus, and beg Him to destroy in us the life of the world of sin, 
				and to establish His life within us. 
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St John Eudes</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Satisfaction consists in the cutting off of the causes of the sin. Thus, fasting is the proper antidote to lust; prayer to pride, to envy, 
				anger and sloth; alms to covetousness."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Richard of Chichester</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"He who does not acquire the love of God will scarcely persevere in the grace of God, for it is very difficult to renounce sin merely through 
				fear of chastisement."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Alphonsus Liguori</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Sins against nature, therefore, like the sin of Sodom, are abominable and deserve punishment whenever and wherever they are committed. If 
				all nations committed them, all alike would be held guilty of the same charge in God’s law, for our Maker did not prescribe that we should 
				use each other in this way. In fact, the relationship that we ought to have with God is itself violated when our nature, of which He is 
				Author, is desecrated by perverted lust.....Your punishments are for sins which men commit against themselves, because, although they sin 
				against You, they do wrong in their own souls and their malice is self-betrayed. They corrupt and pervert their own nature, which You made 
				and for which You shaped the rules, either by making wrong use of the things which You allow, or by becoming inflamed with passion to make 
				unnatural use of things which You do not allow" (Rom. 1:26).
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Augustine of Hippo</em>
				</strong></p>	
								
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"However, they are called passions of ignominy because they are not worthy of being named, according to that passage in Ephesians (5:12): 
				‘For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.’ For if the sins of the flesh are commonly censurable 
				because they lead man to that which is bestial in him, much more so is the sin against nature, by which man debases himself lower than even 
				his animal nature."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Thomas Aquinas</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"No sin has greater power over the soul than the one of cursed sodomy, which was always detested by all those who lived according to God….. 
				Such passion for undue forms borders on madness. This vice disturbs the intellect, breaks an elevated and generous state of soul, drags great 
				thoughts to petty ones, makes [men] pusillanimous and irascible, obstinate and hardened, servilely soft and incapable of anything. 
				Furthermore, the will, being agitated by the insatiable drive for pleasure, no longer follows reason, but furor…. Someone who lived 
				practicing the vice of sodomy will suffer more pains in Hell than any one else, because this is the worst sin that there is."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Bernardine of Siena</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"In the Great Deluge in the days of Noah, nearly all mankind perished, eight persons alone being saved in the Ark. In our days a deluge, not 
				of water but of sins, continually inundates the earth, and out of this deluge very few escape. Scarcely anyone is saved."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Alphonsus Maria Liguori</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Saint Teresa, as the Roman Rota attests, never fell into any mortal sin; but still Our Lord showed her the place prepared for her in Hell; 
				not because she deserved Hell, but because, had she not risen from the state of lukewarmness in which she lived, she would in the end have 
				lost the grace of God and been damned."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Alphonsus Maria Liguori</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Out of one hundred thousand sinners who continue in sin until death, scarcely one will be saved."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Jerome</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"A multitude of souls fall into the depths of Hell, and it is of the faith that all who die in mortal sin are condemned for ever and ever. 
				According to statistics, approximately 80,000 persons die every day. How many of these will die in mortal sin, and how many will be 
				condemned! For, as their lives have been, so also will be their end."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Anthony Mary Claret</em>
				</strong></p>	
			
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Meditate on the horrors of Hell, which will last for eternity because of one easily-committed mortal sin. Try hard to be among the few who 
				are chosen. Think of the eternal flames of Hell, and how few there are that are saved."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Benedict Joseph Labre</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Brethren, the just man shall scarcely be saved. What, then, will become of the sinner?"
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Arsenius</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Among adults there are few saved because of sins of the flesh. [...] With the exception of those who die in childhood, most men will be 
				damned."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Regimius or Rheims</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"O Jesus! [...] Remember the sadness that Thou didst experience when, contemplating in the light of Thy divinity the predestination of those 
				who would be saved by the merits of Thy sacred passion, thou didst see at the same time the great multitude of reprobates who would be damned 
				for their sins, and Thou didst complain bitterly of those hopeless, lost, and unfortunate sinners."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Bridget of Sweden</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Nothing can tend so much to humble us before the mercy and justice of God as the consideration of His benefits and our own sins. Let us, 
				then, consider what He has done for us, and what we have done against Him; let us call to mind our sins in detail, and His gracious benefits 
				in like manner, remembering that whatever there is of good in us is not ours, but His, and then we need not be afraid of vainglory or of 
				taking complacency in ourselves..."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Francis of Sales</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Oh! Could you but see the beauty of a soul in the grace of God, you would be so much enamored of it that you would do nothing else but ask 
				souls of God; and, on the contrary, could a soul in mortal sin be placed before your eyes, you would do nothing but weep, and you would hate 
				sin more than the devil himself, and always pray for the conversion of sinners."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Mary Magdalene de Pazzi</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"The greatest security we can have in this world that we are in the grace of God, does not consist in the feelings that we have of love to 
				Him, but rather in an irrevocable abandonment of our whole being into His hands, and in a firm resolution never to consent to any sin great 
				or small."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Francis of Sales</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
							 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"A sinner cannot outrage the Deity more than by despairing of Divine mercy on account of the number and enormity of his crimes; for God's 
				clemency is far greater than the iniquity and guilt of an entire world . . . Of God's mercy never despair."
				<br/>
