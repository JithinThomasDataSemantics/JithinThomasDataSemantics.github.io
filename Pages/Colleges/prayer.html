				"Prayer -A soul arms itself by prayer for all kinds of combat. In whatever state the soul may be, it ought to pray. A soul which is pure and beautiful must 
				pray, or else it will lose its beauty; a soul which is striving after this purity must pray, or else it will never attain it; a soul which is newly converted 
				must pray, or else it will fall again; a sinful soul, plunged in
				sins, must pray so that it might rise again. There is no soul which is not bound to pray, for every single grace comes to the soul through prayer."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Faustina</em>

				"Prayer is an aspiration of the heart, it is a simple glance directed to heaven, it is a cry of gratitude and love in the midst of trail as well as joy; 
				finally, it is something great, supernatural, which expands my soul and unites me to Jesus."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St.Therese of Lisieux</em>

			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Pray as though everything depended on God. Work as though everything depended on you."

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"There are more tears shed over answered prayers than over unanswered prayers."

			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Virtues are formed by prayer. Prayer preserves temperance. Prayer suppresses anger. Prayer prevents emotions of pride and envy. Prayer draws into the soul the 
				Holy Spirit, and raises man to Heaven."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Ephraem of Syria</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Purity is the fruit of prayer."

				<strong>
					<em>--Saint John Chrysostom</em>

				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. John Chrysostom</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Let us all resign ourselves into His hands, and pray that in all things He may guide us to do His Holy Will... When thoughts of this or that come I turn to 
				Him and say: "Only what you will, my God. Use me as You will."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Blessed Mary MacKillop</em>
				</strong></p>	

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The most potent and acceptable prayer is the prayer that leaves the best effects. I don't mean it must immediately fill the soul with desire... The best 
				effects [are] those that are followed up by actions-----when the soul not only desires the honor of God, but really strives for it."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Teresa of Avila </em>

				"He who prays most receives most."

					<em>--St. Alphonsus Maria de Liguori</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"My little children, your hearts, are small, but prayer stretches them and makes them capable of loving God. Through prayer we receive a foretaste of heaven and 
				something of paradise comes down upon us. Prayer never leaves us without sweetness. It is honey that flows into the souls and makes all things sweet. When we 
				pray properly, sorrows disappear like snow before the sun."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint John Vianney</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Private prayer is like straw scattered here and there: If you set it on fire it makes a lot of little flames. But gather these straws into a bundle and light 
				them, and you get a mighty fire, rising like a column into the sky; public prayer is like that."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint John Vianney</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"We must speak to God as a friend speaks to his friend, servant to his master; now asking some favor, now acknowledging our faults, and communicating to Him 
				all that concerns us, our thoughts, our fears, our projects, our desires, and in all things seeking His counsel."				
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Ignatius of Loyola</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"During mental prayer, it is well, at times, to imagine that many insults and injuries are being heaped upon us, that misfortunes have befallen us, and then 
				strive to train our heart to bear and forgive these things patiently, in imitation of our Saviour. This is the way to acquire a strong spirit."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Philip Neri</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"How often I failed in my duty to God, because I was not leaning on the strong pillar of prayer."

				"Prayer ought to be humble, fervent, resigned, persevering, and accompanied with great reverence. One should consider that he stands in the presence of a God, 
				and speaks with a Lord before whom the angels tremble from awe and fear."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Mary Magdalen de Pazzi</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">

			<p id="blueDiv">
				"The prayer most pleasing to God is that made for others and particularly for the poor souls. Pray for them, if you want your prayers to bring high interest."				
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Anyone who has the habit of speaking before God's majesty as if he were speaking to a slave, careless about how he is speaking, and saying whatever comes into 
				his head and whatever he's learned from saying prayers at other times, in my opinion is not praying. Please, God, may no Christian pray in this way."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Teresa of Avila </em>

				"Let him never cease from prayer who has once begun it, be his life ever so wicked; for prayer is the way to amend it, and without prayer such amendment will be 
				much more difficult."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Teresa of Avila</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Vocal prayer . . . must be accompanied by reflection. A prayer in which a person is not aware of Whom he is speaking to, what he is asking, who it is who is 
				asking and of Whom, I don't call prayer-----however much the lips may move." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Teresa of Avila</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"One must not think that a person who is suffering is not praying. He is offering up his sufferings to God, and many a time he is praying much 
				more truly than one who goes away by himself and meditates his head off, and, if he has squeezed out a few tears, thinks that is prayer."				
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Teresa of Avila</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>				

			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Much more is accomplished by a single word of the Our Father said, now and then, from our heart, than by the whole prayer repeated many times in haste and 
				without attention."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Teresa </em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"My daughter...why do you not tell me about everything that concerns you, even the smallest details? Tell Me about everything, and know that this will give Me 
				great joy. I answered, But You know about everything, Lord." And Jesus replied to me, "Yes I do know; but you should not excuse yourself with the fact that I 
				know, but with childlike simplicity talk to Me about everything, for my ears and heart are inclined towards you, and your words are dear to Me."
				 <br/>

				"Prayer is the inner bath of love into which the soul plunges itself. 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint John Vianney</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"I remind you, My daughter, that as often as you hear the clock strike the third hour, immerse yourself completely in My mercy, adoring and glorifying it; 
				invoke its omnipotence for the whole world, and particularly for poor sinners; for at that moment mercy was opened wide for every soul. In this hour you can 
				obtain everything for yourself and for others for the asking; it was the hour of grace for the whole world - mercy triumphed over justice. My daughter, try 
				your best to make the Stations of the Cross in this hour, provided that your duties permit it; and if you are not able to make the Stations of the Cross, then 
				at least step into the chapel for a moment and adore, in the Blessed Sacrament, My Heart, which is full of mercy; and should you be unable to step into the 
				chapel, immerse yourself in prayer there where you happen to be, if only for a very brief instant. I claim veneration for My mercy from every creature, but 
				above all from you, since it is to you that I have given the most profound understanding of this mystery."

				"Without Prayer nothing good is done. God's works are done with our hands joined, and on our knees. Even when we run, we must remain spiritually kneeling before 
				Him."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Blessed Luigi Orione</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"In order to succeed in it (prayer), it should be done when we first awaken, when our whole being is calm and recollected. We need to make our meditation 
				before anything else."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Peter Julian Eymard</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"We must pray without tiring, for the salvation of mankind does not depend on material success; nor on sciences that cloud the intellect. Neither does it depend 
				on arms and human industries, but on Jesus alone."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St Frances Xavier Cabrini</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Read some chapter of a devout book....It is very easy and most necessary, for just as you speak to God when at prayer, God speaks to you when you read."

				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Vincent de Paul</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Are you making no progress in prayer? Then you need only offer God the prayers which the Savior has poured out for us in the sacrament of the altar. Offer God 
				His fervent love in reparation for your sluggishness."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, from a letter</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"It often happens that we pray God to deliver us from some dangerous temptation, and yet God does not hear us but permits the temptation to continue troubling 
				us. In such a case, let us understand that God permits even this for our greater good. When a soul in temptation recommends itself to God, and by His aid 
				resists, O how it then advances in perfection."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>-- St. Alphonsus Liguori</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>

			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Dreads fasting, prayer, humility, and good works: The devil is not able even to stop my mouth who speak against him. The illusions of the devil soon 
				vanish, especially if a man arms himself with the Sign of the Cross. The devils tremble at the Sign of the Cross of our Lord, by which He triumphed over and 
				disarmed them."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Antony Abbot</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"When I immersed myself in prayer and united myself with all the Masses that were being celebrated all over the world at that time, I implored God, for the sake 
				of all these Holy Masses, to have mercy on the world and especially on poor sinners who were dying at that moment. At the same instant, I received an interior 
				answer from God that a thousand souls had received grace through the prayerful mediation I had offered to God. We do not know the number of souls that is ours 
				to save through our prayers and sacrifices; therefore, let us always pray for sinners."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Faustina, Divine Mercy in my Soul</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"We must meditate before, during and after everything we do. The prophet says: "I will pray, and then I will understand."  This is the way we can easily 
				overcome the countless difficulties we have to face day after day, which, after all, are part of our work. In meditation we find the strength to bring Christ 
				to birth in ourselves and in others."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Charles Borromeo</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"We must pray without ceasing, in every occurrence and employment of our lives - that prayer which is rather a habit of lifting up the heart to God as in a 
				constant communication with Him."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Have confidence in prayer. It is the unfailing power which God has given us. By means of it you will obtain the salvation of the dear souls whom God has given 
				you and all your loved ones." Ask and you shall receive," Our Lord said. Be yourself with the good Lord."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Peter Julian Eymard	</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"As far as possible, you should pray in quiet and silent devotion. Try to have a favorite topic of prayer, such as a devotion to the passion of Jesus, the 
				Blessed Sacrament, awareness of the divine presence; go directly to Jesus without too much fuss."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Peter Julian Eymard</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Prayer ought to be short and pure, unless it be prolonged by the inspiration of Divine grace."
