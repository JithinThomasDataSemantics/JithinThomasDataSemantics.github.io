			"If a man finds it very hard to forgive injuries, let him look at a Crucifix, 
			and think that Christ shed all His Blood for him, and not only forgave His enemies, 
			but even prayed His Heavenly Father to forgive them also. Let him remember that when he says the 
			Pater Noster, every day, instead of asking pardon for his sins, he is calling down vengeance on himself."	
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Philip Neri</em>
				</strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"He who knows how to forgive prepares for himself many graces from God. As often as I look upon the cross, 
				so often will I forgive with all my heart."				 
				<br/>
				 <strong>
					<em>--St. Faustina</em>
				 </strong>
			</p>
							
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"If a man does what he can and is truly penitent, however often he comes to Me for grace and pardon, 
				'As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live'; 
				I will no longer remember his sins, but all will be forgiven him."

				"The patient man goes through a great and salutary purgatory when he grieves more over the malice 
				of one who harms him than for his own injury; when he prays readily for his enemies and forgives
				 offenses from his heart; when he does not hesitate to ask pardon of others;
				 when he is more easily moved to pity than to anger; when he does frequent
				 violence to himself and tries to bring the body into complete subjection to the spirit."

				"Let no one mourn that he has fallen again and again;  for forgiveness has risen from the grave."				
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. John Chrysostom - Easter sermon</em>
				</strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"For there are three ways of performing an act of mercy: the merciful word, by forgiving and by comforting; secondly, 
				if you can offer no word, then pray - that too is mercy; and thirdly, deeds of mercy. And when the Last Day comes,
				 we shall be judged from this, and on this basis we shall receive the eternal verdict." 
				<br/>
				 <strong>
					<em>--Saint Faustina Kowalska</em>
				 </strong>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"To the extent that you pray with all your soul for the person who slanders you,
				 God will make the truth known to those who have been scandalized by the slander."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Maximos the Confessor</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Forgiveness is the remission of sins. For it is by this that what has been lost, and was found, is saved from being lost again."				 
				<br/>
				 <strong>
					<em>--Saint Augustine</em>
				 </strong>
			</p>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Fear and honor, praise and bless, thank and adore the Lord God Almighty, 
				in Trinity and Unity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Creator of all things. Do not put off any 
				longer confessing all your sins, for death will soon come. Give and it will be given you;
				 forgive and you will be forgiven. . . Blessed are they who die repentant, for they shall go to the 
				 Kingdom of Heaven! But woe to those who are not converted, for these children of the Devil will go with their father into everlasting fire.
				 Be watchful, therefore. Shun evil, and persevere in well-doing until the end."
				<br/>

					<em>--Saint Francis of Assisi</em>

				"This Blood that but one drop of has the power to win all the world forgiveness of its world of sin." 				 
				<br/>
				 <strong>
					<em>--St. Thomas Aquinas</em>
				 </strong>
			</p>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"I am innocent and I die innocent. I forgive with all my heart those responsible for my death, 
				and I ask God that the shedding of my blood serves toward the peace of our divided Mexico." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Cristobal just before his executioners fired</em>
				</strong></p>					
		 						
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The Christian law commands that we forgive our enemies and those who have wronged us.
				 I must therefore say here that I forgive Taikosama. I would rather have all the Japanese become Christians." 
				<br/>
				 <strong>
					<em>--Saint Paul Miki one of the Martyrs of Nagasaki</em>
				 </strong>
			</p>			

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Avoid slander because it is difficult to retract. Avoid offending anyone for to ask forgiveness is not delightful."				
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint John Cantius</em>
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"He passed over his fall, and appointed him first of the Apostles; wherefore He said: "Simon, Simon,"etc. (in Ps. cxxix. 2).
				God allowed him to fall, because He meant to make him ruler over the whole world, that, remembering his own fall, 
				he might forgive those who should slip in the future. And that what I have said is no guess, listen to Christ Himself saying: 
				"Simon, Simon, etc.""
