				"Holiness is a disposition of the heart that makes us humble and little in the arms of God, aware of our weakness, and confident -- in the 
				most audacious way -- in His Fatherly goodness."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Therese of the Infant Jesus</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The state of grace is nothing other than purity, and it gives heaven to those who clothe themselves in it. Holiness, therefore, is simply the 
				state of grace purified, illuminated, beautified by the most perfect purity, exempt not only from mortal sin but also from the smallest 
				faults; purity will make saints of you! Everything lies in this!"
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Peter Eymard</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"There is no surer way to know that one is a saint than to see him lead a holy life and yet suffer desolation, trials and tribulations."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Louis Gonzaga</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Our Lord has created persons for all states in life, and in all of them we see people who achieved sanctity by fulfilling their obligations 
				well."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Anthony Mary Claret</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"That the saints may enjoy their beatitude and the grace of God more abundantly they are permitted to see the punishment of the damned in hell"
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Thomas Aquinas</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"We must have a real living determination to reach holiness. I will be a saint means I will despoil myself of all that is not God; I will 
				strip my heart of all created things; I will live in poverty and detachment; I will renounce my will, my inclinations, my whims and fancies, 
				and make myself a willing slave to the will of God."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Blessed Mother Teresa</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Nothing whatever pertaining to godliness and real holiness can be accomplished without grace."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Augustine</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Godâ€™s invitation to become saints is for all, not just a few. Sanctity therefore must be accessible to all. In what does it consist? In a lot 
				of activity? No. In doing extraordinary things? No, this could not be for everybody and at all times. Therefore, sanctity consists in doing 
				good, and in doing this good in whatever condition and place God has placed us. Nothing more, nothing outside of this."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Blessed Louis Tezza</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"If God gives you an abundant harvest of trials, it is a sign of great holiness which He desires you to attain. Do you want to become a great 
				saint? Ask God to send you many sufferings. The flame of Divine Love never rises higher than when fed with the wood of the Cross, which the 
				infinite charity of the Savior used to finish His sacrifice. All the pleasures of the world are nothing compared with the sweetness found in 
				the gall and vinegar offered to Jesus Christ. That is, hard and painful things endured for Jesus Christ and with Jesus Christ."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Ignatius of Loyola</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"All of us can attain to Christian virtue and holiness, no matter in what condition of life we live and no matter what our life work may be."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Francis de Sales</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Sanctify yourself and you will sanctify society."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Francis of Assisi</em>
				</strong></p>	
				

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The more a person loves God, the more reason he has to hope in Him. This hope produces in the Saints an unutterable peace, which they 
				preserve even in adversity, because as they love God, and know how beautiful He is to those who love Him, they place all their confidence and 
				find all their repose in Him alone."
				<br/>
