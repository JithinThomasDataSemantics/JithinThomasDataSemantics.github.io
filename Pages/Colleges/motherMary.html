				"Happy, indeed sublimely happy, is the person to whom the Holy Spirit reveals the secret of Mary, 
				thus imparting to him true knowledge of her. Happy the person to whom the Holy Spirit opens this enclosed garden
				for him to enter, and to whom the Holy Spirit gives access to this sealed fountain where he can draw water and drink 
				deep draughts of the living waters of grace. That person will find only grace and no creature in the most lovable Virgin Mary.
				But he will find that the infinitely holy and exalted God is at the same time infinitely solicitous for him
				and understands his weaknesses. Since God is everywhere, he can be found everywhere, even in hell. 
				But there is no place where God can be more present to his creature and more sympathetic to human weakness than in Mary.
				It was indeed for this very purpose that he came down from heaven. 
				Everywhere else he is the Bread of the strong and the Bread of angels, but living in Mary he is the Bread of children."
