				"I know the power obedience has of making things easy which seem impossible."

				"Without a doubt, obedience is more meritorious than any other penance. 
				And what greater penance can there be than keeping one's will continually submissive and obedient?"

				"The power of obedience! The lake of Gennesareth had denied its fishes to Peter’s nets. 
				A whole night in vain. Then, obedient, he lowered his net again to the water and they caught 
				‘a huge number of fish.’ Believe me: the miracle is repeated each day."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>–-St. Josemaria Escriva</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"I often thought my constitution would never endure the work I had to do, (but) the Lord said to me: ‘Daughter, obedience gives strength.’"

					 <em>–-St. Teresa of Avila</em>

			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"On each occasion I say: ‘Lord, thy will be done! It’s not what this or that one wants, but what You want me to do.’ 
				This is my fortress, this is my firm rock, this is my sure support."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>–-St. John Chrysostom</em>
				</strong></p>	

			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Obedience, is rightly placed before all other sacrifices, for in offering a victim as sacrifice, 
				one offers a life that is not one’s own; but when one obeys one is immolating one’s own will."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Gregory the Great</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The Devil doesn’t fear austerity but holy obedience."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>– St. Francis de Sales</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Obedience unites us so closely to God that in a way transforms us into Him, so that we have no 
				other will but His. If obedience is lacking, even prayer cannot be pleasing to God."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>– St. Thomas Aquinas</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"A Christian faithful to obedience, knows not delays, but prepares his ears for hearing, 
				and his hands and his feet for labor."
				<strong><br/>

				No man commands safely unless he has learned well how to obey."

					<em>--Imitation of Christ</em>
				</strong></p>

			<p id="blueDiv">
				"It is better to cherish the humble desire of living according to the rule of the community, 
				and to be diligent in its observance, than to entertain exalted desires of performing imaginary 
				wonders, for such imaginations only tend to swell our hearts with pride, lead us to undervalue 
				our brethren, from an impression that we are better than they."

				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Pacomius</em>

			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"My daughter, know that you give Me greater glory by a single act of obedience than by long prayers and mortifications."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--St Faustina, Divine Mercy in my Soul</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Don't give in to discouragement....... If you are discouraged it is a sign of pride because 
				it shows you trust in your own powers. Never bother about people's opinions. Be obedient to truth. 
				For with humble obedience, you will never be disturbed."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>-- Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"We must put aside all judgment of our own, and keep the mind ever ready and
				 prompt to obey in all things the true Spouse of Christ our Lord, 
				 our holy Mother, the hierarchical Church."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Ignatius of Loyola</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"It is a very great thing to obey, to live under a superior and not to be one's 
				own master, for it is much safer to be subject than it is to command. Many live 
				in obedience more from necessity than from love. Such become discontented and 
				dejected on the slightest pretext; they will never gain peace of mind unless 
				they subject themselves wholeheartedly for the love of God.
				Go where you may, you will find no rest except in humble obedience 
				to the rule of authority. Dreams of happiness expected from change 
				and different places have deceived many."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Imitation of Christ</em>

			 </p>
			
			 <p id="yellowDiv">
				"It is much safer to obey, than to govern."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Kempis, Thomas</em>
				</strong></p>				

			<p id="blueDiv">
				"The obedience which we render to a superior is paid to God, 
				Who says, ‘He that hears you hears Me;’ so that whatever he 
				who holds the place of God commands, supposing it is not evidently 
				contrary to God's law, is to be received by us as if it came from God 
				Himself; for it is the same thing to know His Will, either from His Own, 
				from an Angel's, or from a man's mouth."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, Father and Doctor of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			 <p id="yellowDiv">
				"Obedience is a virtue of so excellent a nature, that Our Lord was pleased 
				to mark its observance upon the whole course of His life; thus He often says, 
				He did not come to do His Own will, but that of His Heavenly Father."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Francis of Sales, Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Naturally we all have an inclination to command, and a great aversion to obey; 
				and yet it is certain that it is more for our good to obey than to command; 
				hence perfect souls have always had a great affection for obedience, and have 
				found all their joy and comfort in it."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Francis of Sales, Doctor of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Learn to obey, you who are but dust! Learn to humble yourself, you who 
				are but earth and clay, and bow down under the foot of every man! Learn 
				to break your own will, to submit to all subjection! Be zealous against 
				yourself! Allow no pride to dwell in you, but prove yourself so humble and 
				lowly that all may walk over you and trample upon you as dust in the streets!"
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Imitation of Christ</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Obedience is a consecration of the heart, chastity of the body, and poverty of all worldly goods to the Love and Service of God. 
				Blessed indeed are the obedient, for God will never permit them to go astray."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Francis De Sales</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Saint Paul commands us to obey all superiors, even those who are bad. Our Blessed Saviour, 
				His Virgin Mother, and Saint Joseph have taught us this kind of obedience in the journey they 
				took from Nazareth to Bethlehem, when Caesar published an edict that his subjects should repair 
				to the place of their nativity to be enrolled. They complied with this order with the most 
				affectionate obedience, though the Emperor was a pagan and an idolator, so desirous was Our 
				Lord of showing us that we should never regard the persons of those who command, provided they 
				be invested with sufficient authority."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Francis of Sales, Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"One of the greatest graces for which I feel myself indebted to Our Lord is, 
				that His Divine Majesty has given me the desire to be obedient; 
				for in this virtue I find most consolation and contentment, 
				it being that which Our Lord recommended by His own example more than any other, 
				and on this account I desire to possess it more than anything else in the world."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Teresa of Avila, Doctor of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			 <p id="yellowDiv">
				"The more we see that any action springs not from the motive of obedience, 
				the more evident is it that it is a temptation of the enemy; for when God sends an inspiration, the 
				very first effect of it is to infuse a spirit of docility."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Teresa of Avila, Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Obedience is a short cut to perfection. They who are living under obedience, if they really wish 
				to advance in the ways of God, must give themselves up always and in all things into the hands of 
				their superiors; and they who are not living under obedience must subject themselves to some learned and 
				discreet confessor, whom they may obey in the place of God, disclosing to him, with perfect candor and simplicity, 
				the affairs of their soul; and they should never come to any resolution without his advice.
				 Nothing gives greater security to our actions, or more effectually cuts the snares the devil lays 
				 for us, than to follow another person's will, rather than our own, in doing good."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Philip Neri</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"He who always acts under obedience may be assured that he will not have to give an account of his actions to God."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Philip Neri</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"By the other virtues, we offer God what we possess; but by obedience, we offer ourselves to Him. 
				They who obey are conquerors, because by submitting themselves to obedience they triumph over the Angels,
				 who fell through disobedience."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Pope Saint Gregory the Great, Father and Doctor of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Obedience is a penance of reason, and, on that account, a sacrifice more acceptable 
				than all corporal penances and mortifications."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint John of the Cross, Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"God is more pleased to behold the lowest degree of obedience, for His sake, than all 
				other good works which you can possibly offer to Him."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint John of the Cross, Doctor of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"A single instant passed under simple obedience is immeasurably more valuable 
				in the sight of God than an entire day spent in the most sublime contemplation."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Mary Magdalene de Pazzi</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"He who follows his own ideas in opposition to the direction of his superiors 
				needs no devil to tempt him, for he is a devil to himself."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint John Climacus</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"There are three sorts of obedience; the first, obedience when a strict obligation 
				is imposed upon us, and this is good; the second when the simple word of the superior,
				 without any strict command, suffices for us, and this is better; the third, when a thing is 
				 done without waiting for an express command, from a knowledge that it will be pleasing to the superior, 
				 and this is the best of all."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Ignatius, Father of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"See God in your superiors; so shall you learn to revere their will and follow their commands. 
				Be well assured that obedience is the safest guide and most faithful interpreter of the Divine Will..
				Pour out your hearts to them as freely as water, mindful that they are charged with the direction of your souls.
				 Above all, do not be your own master, relying on your own prudence, contrary to the caution of the wise man."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Ignatius, Father of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"He that is truly obedient does not wait for a command, 
				but as soon as he knows what his superior wishes to have done 
				immediately sets himself to work, without expecting an order."
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Albert the Great, Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"All that is done by obedience is meritorious . . . It is obedience, which, 
				by the light of Faith, puts self-will to death, and causes the obedient man to 
				despise his own will and throw himself into the arms of his superior...
				 Placed in the bark of obedience, he passes happily through the stormy sea of this life, 
				 in peace of soul and tranquility of heart. Obedience and faith disperse darkness; 
				 he is strong because he has no longer any weakness or fears, for self-will, which is 
				 the cause of inordinate fear and weakness, has been destroyed."				
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Catherine of Siena, Doctor of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Oh! how sweet and glorious is the virtue of obedience, by which all other virtues exist, 
				because it is the offspring of charity! On it is founded the rock of faith; it is a queen, 
				whom he that espouses is rich in every kind of good and whom no evil can assail."				
				<strong><br/>
					<em>--Saint Catherine of Siena, Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"Obedience is mission: "I have come into this world to do the will of my Father, 
				who has sent me." Where there is no obedience, there is no virtue; where there is no virtue there is no good; 
				where good is wanting, there is no love, there is no God; where God is not, there is no Heaven."
