				"One of the most admirable effects of Holy Communion is to preserve the soul from sin, and to help those who fall through weakness 
				to rise again. It is much more profitable, then, to approach this divine Sacrament with love, respect, and confidence,
				 than to remain away through an excess of fear and scrupulosity."			
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Ignatius of Loyola</em>

				"If it is "daily bread," why do you take it once a year? . . . Take daily what is to profit you daily.
				 Live in such a way that you may deserve to receive it daily. He who does not deserve to receive it daily,
				 does not deserve to receive it once a year."
				<br/>

				"When the bee has gathered the dew of heaven and the earth's sweetest nectar from the flowers,
				 it turns it into honey, then hastens to its hive. In the same way, the priest, 
				 having taken from the altar the Son of God (who is as the dew from heaven, 
				 and true son of Mary, flower of our humanity), gives him to you as delicious food."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Francis de Sales</em>

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Every morning during meditation, I prepare myself for the whole day's struggle. 
				Holy Communion assures me that I will win the victory; and so it is. I fear the day when 
				I do not receive Holy Communion. This bread of the Strong gives me all the strength 
				I need to carry on my mission and the courage to do whatever the Lord asks of me. 
				The courage and strength that are in me are not of me, but of Him who lives in me - it is the Eucharist."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Faustina	</em>

				"Always remain close to the Catholic Church, because it alone can give you true peace, 
				since it alone possesses Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, the true Prince of Peace."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Padre Pio</em>

			</p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"With all the strength of my soul I urge you young people to approach the Communion table as often as you can.
				 Feed on this bread of angels whence you will draw all the energy you need to fight inner battles. 
				 Because true happiness, dear friends, does not consist in the pleasures of the world or in earthly things,
				 but in peace of conscience, which we have only if we are pure in heart and mind."				
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati</em>
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				If someone knows from experience that daily Communion increases fervor without lessening reverence, 
				then let him go every day. But if someone finds that reverence is lessened and devotion not much increased,
				 then let him sometimes abstain, so as to draw near afterwards with better dispositions."				
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Thomas Aquinas</em>

				"When you approach the tabernacle remember that he has been waiting for you for twenty centuries."

			</p>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"All the good works in the world are not equal to the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass because they are the works of men;
				 but the Mass is the work of God. Martyrdom is nothing in comparison for it is but the sacrifice of man to God; 
				 but the Mass is the sacrifice of God for man."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. John Vianney, Cure d'Ars</em>
				</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Many Christians take their time and have leisure enough in their social life (no hurry here).
				 They are leisurely, too, in their professionally activities, at table and recreation (no hurry here either).
				 But isn't it strange how those same Christians find themselves in such a rush and want to hurry the priest,
				 in their anxiety to shorten the time devoted to the most holy sacrifice of the altar?" 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Josemaria Escriva</em>
				</strong>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Be the apostle of the divine Eucharist, like a flame which enlightens and warms,
				 like the Angel of his heart who will go to proclaim him to those who don't know him and 
				 will encourage those who love him and are suffering."

				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Peter Julian Eymard</em>
				</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"How kind is our Sacramental Jesus! He welcomes you at any hour of the day or night. 
				His Love never knows rest. He is always most gentle towards you. When you visit Him, 
				He forgets your sins and speaks only of His joy, His tenderness, and His Love. 
				By the reception He gives to you, one would think He has need of you to make Him happy."  				
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Peter Julian Eymard</em>
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Live on the divine Eucharist, like the Hebrews did on the Manna. Your soul can be entirely dedicated to the
				 divine Eucharist and very holy in the midst of your work and contacts with the world." 			
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Peter Julian Eymard</em>
				</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"He said: This is my Body; therefore the Eucharist is not the figure of his Body and Blood,
				 as some have said, talking nonsense in their stupid minds, but it is in very truth the Blood and Body of Christ." 				
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Macarius the Great</em>
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"The Blessed Sacrament is indeed the stimulus for us all, for me as it should be for you,
				 to forsake all worldly ambitions. Without the constant presence of our Divine Master upon
				 the altar in my poor chapels, I never could have persevered casting my lot with the lepers of Molokai;
				 the foreseen consequence of which begins now to appear on my skin, and is felt throughout the body. 
				 Holy Communion being the daily bread of a priest, I feel myself happy, well pleased, and resigned 
				 in the rather exceptional circumstances in which it has pleased Divine Providence to put me." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Blessed Fr. Damien, Apostle of the Lepers</em>
				</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The devotion to the Eucharist is the most noble,
				 because it has God as its object; it is the most profitable for salvation, 
				 because it gives us the Author of Grace; it is the sweetest, because the Lord is Sweetness Itself." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Pope St. Pius X</em>
				</strong>
			</p>
				
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"When we work hard, we must eat well. What a joy, that you can receive Holy Communion often!
				 It's our life and support in this life -- Receive Communion often, and Jesus will change you into himself." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Peter Julian Eymard</em>
				</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Have a great love for Jesus in his divine Sacrament of Love; that is the divine oasis of the desert. 
				It is the heavenly manna of the traveller. It is the Holy Ark. It is the life and Paradise of love on earth."  
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Peter Julian Eymard</em>
				</strong>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"We must understand that in order 'to do', we must first learn 'to be', that is to say, in the sweet company of

			</p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Of all devotions, that of adoring Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament is the greatest after the sacraments,

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"God dwells in our midst, in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar.
				He remains among us until the end of the world. He dwells on so many altars, though so often offended and profaned.
				The culmination of the Mass is not the consecration, but Communion."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Maximilian Kolbe</em>
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"When the Mass is being celebrated, the sanctuary is filled with countless angels,

					<em>â€”St. John Chrysostom</em>

			<p id="yellowDiv">

				"You come to me and unite Yourself intimately to me under the form of nourishment.

				What miracles! Who would have ever imagined such!"
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Maximilian Kolbe</em>

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"O Lord, we cannot go to the pool of Siloe to which you sent the blind man.

				<strong>
					<em>--St. Ephraem</em>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Jesus has made Himself the Bread of Life to give us life. Night and day, He is there.

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"I desire to unite Myself to human souls, Know, My daughter, that when I come to a human heart in Holy Communion, 
				My hands are full of all kinds of graces which I want to give to the soul. But souls do not even pay any attention to Me; 
				they leave Me to Myself and busy themselves with other things...They treat Me as a dead object.
				Now you shall consider My love in the Blessed Sacrament. Here, I am entirely yours, soul, body and divinity, as your Bridegroom. 
				You know what love demands: one thing only, reciprocity..."

				"What wonderful majesty! What stupendous condescension! O sublime humility!

				"Do you realize that Jesus is there in the tabernacle expressly for you - for you alone?

				if you want to be cured. Jesus has not put this attraction in your heart for nothing.The guest of our soul knows our misery;

				"Any devout person may at any hour on any day receive Christ in spiritual communion profitably and without hindrance.
