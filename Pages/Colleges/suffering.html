				"As iron is fashioned by fire and on the anvil, so in the fire of suffering and under the weight of trials, our souls receive that form which 
				our Lord desires them to have."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Madeline Sophie Barat</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"If God gives you an abundant harvest of trials, it is a sign of great holiness which He desires you to attain. Do you want to become a great 
				saint? Ask God to send you many sufferings. The flame of Divine Love never rises higher than when fed with the wood of the Cross, which the 
				infinite charity of the Savior used to finish His sacrifice. All the pleasures of the world are nothing compared with the sweetness found in 
				the gall and vinegar offered to Jesus Christ. That is, hard and painful things endured for Jesus Christ and with Jesus Christ."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Ignatius of Loyola</em>

				"When it is all over you will not regret having suffered; rather you will regret having suffered so little, and suffered that little so badly."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Sebastian Valfre</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"I do not desire to die soon, because in Heaven there is no suffering. I desire to live a long time because I yearn to suffer much for the 
				love of my Spouse."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"You will be consoled according to the greatness of your sorrow and affliction; the greater the suffering, the greater will be the reward." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Mary Magdalen de'Pazzi</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"For my heart is always with Him, day and night it thinks unceasingly of its heavenly and divine Friend, to whom it wants to prove its 
				affection. Also within it arises this desire: not to die, but to suffer long, to suffer for God, to give Him its life while praying for poor 
				sinners."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Bl Elizabeth of the Trinity</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Always remember to love your neighbor; always prefer the one who tries your patience, who test your virtue, because with her you can always 
				merit: suffering is Love; the Law is Love."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Bl Mary of Jesus Crucified "The Little Arab"</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"I desire to suffer always and not to die. I should add: this is not my will, it is my inclination. It is sweet to think of Jesus; but it is 
				sweeter to do His will."

				"If God sends you many sufferings, it is a sign that He has great plans for you and certainly wants to make you a saint."

				<strong>
					<em>--St. Ignatius Loyola</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The road is narrow. He who wishes to travel it more easily must cast off all things and use the cross as his cane. In other words, he must be 
				truly resolved to suffer willingly for the love of God in all things."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. John of the Cross</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"One must not think that a person who is suffering is not praying. He is offering up his sufferings to God, and many a time he is praying much 
				more truly than one who goes away by himself and meditates his head off, and, if he has squeezed out a few tears, thinks that is prayer."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Teresa of Avila</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Suffering is a great favor. Remember that everything soon comes to an end... and take courage. Think of how our gain is eternal."

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Suffering is a great grace; through suffering the soul becomes like the Saviour; in suffering love becomes crystallised; the greater the 
				suffering, the purer the love."

			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"He who wishes to love God does not truly love Him if he has not an ardent and constant desire to suffer for His sake."

				"In suffering love and in loving, suffer!"

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"It is You Jesus, stretched out on the cross, who gives me strength and are always close to the suffering soul. Creatures will abandon a 
				person in his suffering, but You, O Lord, are faithful..."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Faustina</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"We should strive to keep our hearts open to the sufferings and wretchedness of other people, and pray continually that God may grant us that

				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Vincent de Paul</em>

			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"I always want to see you behaving like a brave soldier who does not complain about his own suffering but takes his comrades' wounds

				"God had one son on earth without sin, but never one without suffering."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Augustine of Hippo</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"All the science of the Saints is included in these two things: To do, and to suffer. And whoever had done these two things best, has made 
				himself most saintly."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Francis de Sales</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"The more the wicked abound, so much the more must we suffer with them in patience; for on the threshing floor few are the grains carried 
				into the barns, but high are the piles of chaff burned with fire."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Pope Saint Gregory the Great</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Nothing afflicts the heart of Jesus so much as to see all His sufferings of no avail to so many."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint John Mary Vianney</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"One day, I saw two roads. One was broad, covered with sand and flowers, full of joy, music and all sorts of pleasures. People walked along 
				it, dancing and enjoying themselves. They reached the end of the road without realizing it. And at the end of the road there was a horrible 
				precipice; that is, the abyss of hell. The souls fell blindly into it; as they walked, so they fell. And there numbers were so great that it 
				was impossible to count them. And I saw the other road, or rather, a path, for it was narrow and strewn with thorns and rocks; and the people 
				who walked along it had tears in their eyes, and all kinds of suffering befell them. Some fell down upon the rocks, but stood up immediately 
				and went on. At the end of the road there was a magnificent garden filled with all sorts of happiness, and all these souls entered there. At 
				the very first instant they forgot all their sufferings."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"I see around me a multitude of those who, blindly persevering in error, despise the true God; but I am a Christian nevertheless, and I 
				follow the instruction of the Apostles. If this deserves chastisement, reward it; for I am determined to suffer every torture rather then 
				become the slave of the devil. Others may do as they please since they are [...] reckless of the future life, which is to be obtained only by 
				sufferings. Scripture tells us that "narrow is the way that leads to life" [...] because it is one of affliction and of persecutions suffered 
				for the sake of justice; but it is wide enough for those who walk upon it, because their faith and the hope of an eternal reward make it so 
				for them. [...] On the contrary, the road of vice is in reality narrow, and it leads to an eternal precipice."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Leo of Patara</em>

				"If you really want to love Jesus, first learn to suffer, because suffering teaches you to love."	
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Gemma Galgani</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Our Lord and Savior lifted up his voice and said with incomparable majesty: "Let all men know that grace comes after tribulation. Let them 
				know that without the burden of afflictions it is impossible to reach the height of grace. Let them know that the gifts of grace increase as 
				the struggles increase. Let men take care not to stray and be deceived. This is the only true stairway to paradise, and without the cross 
				they can find no road to climb to heaven."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Rose of Lima</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"When I heard these words, a strong force came upon me and seemd to place me in the middle of a street, so that I might say in a loud voice to 
				people of every age, sex and status: "Hear, O people; hear, O nations. I am warning you about the commandment of Christ by using words that 
				came from his own lips: We cannot obtain grace unless we suffer afflictions. We must heap trouble upon trouble to attain a deep aprticipation 
				in the divine nature, the glory of the sons of God and perfect happiness of soul."			
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Rose of Lima</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"If only mortals would learn how great it is to possess divine grace, how beautiful, how noble, how precious. How many riches it hides within 
				itself, how many joys and delights! No one would complain about his cross or about troubles that may happen to him, if he would come to know 
				the scales on which they are weighed when they are distributed to men."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Rose of Lima</em>
				 </strong>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"The nothing keeps silent, the nothing does not want to be, the nothing suffers all. The nothing does not impose itself, the nothing does not 
				command with authority, and finally, the nothing in the creature is practical humility."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Angela of the Cross Guerrero</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"If you seek patience, you will find no better example than the cross. Great patience occurs in two ways: either when one patiently suffers 
				much, or when one suffers things which one is able to avoid and yet does not avoid. Christ endured much on the cross, and did so patiently, 
				because when he suffered he did not threaten; he was led like a sheep to the slaughter and he did not open his mouth."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Thomas Aquinas</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Let us therefore without ceasing hold fast by our hope and by the earnest of our righteousness, which is Jesus Christ who took up our sins in 
				His own body upon the tree, who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth, but for our sakes He endured all things, that we might live 
				in Him. Let us therefore become imitators of His endurance; and if we should suffer for His name's sake, let us glorify Him. For He gave this 
				example to us in His own person, and we believed this."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Ploycarp of Smyrna</em>
				</strong></p>	
								
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Oh, if you had tasted the delights with which God fills the souls of those who serve him and suffer for him, how would you condemn all that 
				the world can promise! I now begin to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, since for his love I am in prison, where I suffer much. But I assure 
				you, that when I am fainting with hunger, God hath fortified me by his sweet consolations, so that I have looked upon myself as well 
				recompensed for his service. And though I were yet to pass many years in prison, the time would appear short, through the extreme desire 
				which I feel of suffering for him, who even here so well repays our labours. Besides other sickness, I have been afflicted with a continual 
				fever a hundred days without any remedies or proper nourishment. All this time my heart was so full of joy that it seemed to me too narrow to 
				contain it. I have never felt any equal to it, and I thought myself at the gates of paradise."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Blessed Charles Spinola</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Dear brothers and sisters, I pray God may open your eyes and let you see what hidden treasures he bestows on us in the trials from which the 
				world thinks only to flee. Shame turns into honor when we seek God's glory. Present affliction become the source of heavenly glory. To those 
				who suffer wounds in fighting his battles God opens his arms in loving, tender friendship. That is why he (Christ) tells us that if we want 
				to join him, we shall travel the way he took. It is surely not right that the Son of God should go his way on the path of shame while the 
				sons of men walk the way of worldly honor: 'The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant greater than his master.'"

				"If we only knew the precious treasure hidden in infirmities, we would receive them with teh same joy with which we receive the greatest 
				benefits, and we would bear them without ever complaining or showing signs of weariness."
