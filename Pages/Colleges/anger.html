				"When you feel the assaults of passion and anger, then is the time to be silent as Jesus was silent in the midst of His ignominies and sufferings. 
				O holy silence, rich in great virtues! O holy silence, which is a key of gold, keeping in safety the great treasure of holy virtues!"
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--St. Paul of the Cross</em>
			 </strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Virtues are formed by prayer. Prayer preserves temperance. Prayer suppresses anger. 
                Prayer prevents emotions of pride and envy. Prayer draws into the soul the Holy Spirit, and raises man to Heaven."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Ephraem of Syria</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Take pains to refrain from sharp words. Pardon one another so that later on you will not remember the injury.
				 The recollection of an injury is itself wrong. It adds to our anger, nurtures our sins and hates what is good. 
				 It is a rusty arrow and poison for the soul. It puts all virtue to flight."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Francis of Paola</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Be gentle to all and stern with yourself."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Teresa of Avila</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"The humble live in continuous peace, while in the hearts of the proud are envy and frequent anger."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Imitation of Christ</em>
			 </strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Most emphatically I say it, If possible, fall out with no one, and on no pretext whatever suffer your heart to admit anger and passion. 
				Saint James says, plainly and unreservedly, that "the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--St. Francis de Sales</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"It is better not to allow anger, however just and reasonable, to enter at all, than to admit it in ever so slight a degree; 
				once admitted, it will not be easily expelled, for, though at first but a small plant, it will immediately grow into a large tree."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Augustine</em>
			 </strong></p>
	
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Grace looks to eternal things and does not cling to those which are temporal, 
				being neither disturbed at loss nor angered by hard words, because she has placed her treasure and joy in heaven where nothing is lost."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Imitation of Christ</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"If, when stung by slander or ill-nature, we wax proud and swell with anger, 
				it is a proof that our gentleness and humility are unreal, and mere artificial show."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--St. Francis de Sales</em>
			 </strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Correction given in anger, however tempered by reason, never has so much effect as that which is given altogether without anger;
				for the reasonable soul being naturally subject to reason, it is a mere tyranny which subjects it to passion, 
				and whereinsoever reason is led by passion it becomes odious, and its just rule obnoxious."				
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--St. Francis de Sales</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"There is no sin or wrong that gives a man a foretaste of hell in this life as anger and impatience."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Catherine of Sienna	</em>
			 </strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Dismiss all anger, and look a little into yourself. Remember that he of whom you are speaking is your brother, and, as
				 he is in the way of salvation, God can make him a Saint, notwithstanding his present weaknesses. 
				 You may fall into the same faults or perhaps into a worse fault. But supposing that you remain upright, 
				 to whom are you indebted for it, if not to the pure mercy of God?"			
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Thomas of Villanova	</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Depend upon it, it is better to learn how to live without being angry than to imagine one can moderate and control anger lawfully;
				 and if through weakness and frailty one is overtaken by it, it is far better to put it away forcibly than to parley with it; 
				 for give anger ever so little way, and it will become master, like the serpent, who easily works in its body wherever it can once introduce 
				 its head."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--St. Francis de Sales, Introduction to the Devout Life</em>
			 </strong></p>
		 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"If one desire the taking of vengeance in any way whatever contrary to the order of reason, for instance 
				if he desire the punishment of one who has not deserved it, or beyond his deserts, or again contrary to the 
				order prescribed by law, or not for the due end, namely the maintaining of justice and the correction of defaults,
				 then the desire of anger will be sinful, and this is called sinful anger."				
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--St. Thomas Aquinas</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Nothing is more powerful than meekness. For as fire is extinguished by water, so a mind inflated by anger is subdued by meekness. 
				By meekness we practice and make known our virtue, and also cause the indignation of our brother to cease,
				 and deliver his mind from perturbation."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint John Chrysostom</em>
			 </strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"There is an anger which is engendered of evil, and there is an anger engendered of good.
				 Hastiness of temper is the cause of the evil, divine principle is the cause of the good,
				 such as that which Phinees felt when he allayed God's anger by the use of his own sword."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Pope St. Gregory the Great</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"When we have to reply to anyone who has insulted us, we should be careful to do it always with meekness. 
				A soft answer extinguishes the fire of wrath. If we feel ourselves angry, it is better for us to be silent,
				 because we should speak amiss; when we become tranquil, we shall see that all our words were culpable."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Alphonsus Liguori, Doctor of the Church</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Many appear full of mildness and sweetness as long as everything goes their own way; 
				but the moment any contradiction or adversity arises, they are in a flame, and begin to rage like a burning mountain. 
				Such people as these are like red-hot coals hidden under ashes. This is not the mildness which Our Lord undertook
				to teach us in order to make us like unto Himself."				
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Bernard of Clairvaux</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"There are two methods to subdue anger. First, that before a person undertakes to act, 
				he places before his mind the contumelies and sufferings which he will likely encounter, 
				and, by reflecting on the shame borne by our Saviour, prepares himself to bear them patiently. 
				Secondly, that when we behold the excesses of others, we direct our thoughts to our own excesses,
				by which we offend others. This consideration of our own faults will lead us to excuse those of others.
				For a person who piously considers that he also has something which others must bear patiently in him will be easily 
				disposed to bear patiently injuries he receives from others."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Pope Saint Gregory the Great</em>
			 </strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"In the Christian combat, not the striker, as in the Olympic contests, but he who is struck, wins the crown.
				 This is the law in the celestial theatre, where the Angels are the spectators."		
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint John Chrysostom</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"In order to avoid contention, never contradict anyone, except in case of sin or some danger to a neighbor;
				 and when necessary to contradict others, and to oppose your opinion to theirs, do it with so much mildness and tact,
				 as not to appear to do violence to their mind, for nothing is ever gained by taking up things with excessive warmth and hastiness."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--King Saint Louis</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"It is better to err by excess of mercy than by excess of severity
				...Wilt thou become a Saint? Be severe to thyself but kind to others."				
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint John Chrysostom</em>
			 </strong></p>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"If, on a rare occasion, it is necessary to speak with some severity in order to make a grievous crime felt, 
				we should always, at the conclusion of the rebuke, add some kind words. We must heal wounds, as the Samaritan did, 
				with wine and oil. But as oil floats above all other liquors, so meekness should predominate in all our actions."
				<br/>
			 <strong>
				<em>--Saint Alphonsus Liguori</em>
			 </strong></p>
			
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Be as gentle always as possible; and remember that you will catch more flies with a spoonful of honey than with a hundred barrels
				 of vinegar. Such is the nature of the human mind; it rebels against severity, but gentleness renders it amenable to everything.
				 A soft word appeases anger, as water extinguishes fire. No soul so ungrateful, but kindness can make it bear fruit.
				 To speak truths sweetly is to throw burning coals, or rather roses, into a person's face. How can anyone be angry with another 
				 who fights him with pearls and diamonds?"
