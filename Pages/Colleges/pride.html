				"The proud person is like a grain of wheat thrown into water: it swells, it gets big. Expose that grain to the fire: it dries up, it burns. The humble soul is 
				like a grain of wheat thrown into the earth: it descends, it hides itself, it disappears, it dies; but to revive in heaven."  
				<br/>

					<em>--Bl Mary of Jesus Crucified "The Little Arab"</em>

				"God walks with sincere men, reveals Himself to humble men, enlightens the understanding of pure minds, and hides His grace from the curious and the proud."

				"The greatest misery does not stop Me from uniting Myself to a soul, but where there is pride, I am not there."

				"It was pride that changed angels into devils; it is humility that makes men as angels."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Augustine</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Do not think yourself better than others lest, perhaps, you be accounted worse before God Who knows what is in man. Do not take pride in your good deeds, for 
				God's judgments differ from those of men and what pleases them often displeases Him."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Imitation of Christ</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"I do not desire consolation that robs me of contrition, nor do I care for contemplation that leads to pride, for not all that is high is holy, nor is all that 
				is sweet good, nor every desire pure, nor all that is dear to us pleasing to God."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Imitation of Christ</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"It is better for you to have little than to have much which may become the source of pride."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Imitation of Christ</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Allow no pride to dwell in you, but prove yourself so humble and lowly that all may walk over you and trample upon you as dust in the streets!"
				 <br/>
				 <strong>

			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Humility is the only thing that no devil can imitate."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>-- St John Climacus</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Envy, my children, follows pride; whoever is envious is proud. See, envy comes to us from Hell; the devils having sinned through pride, sinned also through 
				envy, envying our glory, our happiness. Why do we envy the happiness and the goods of others? Because we are proud; we should like to be the sole possessors of 
				talents, riches, of the esteem and love of all the world! We hate our equals, because they are our equals; our inferiors, from the fear that they may equal us; 
				our superiors, because they are above us."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint John Vianney</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"God refuses only the person who does not admit his own weakness; He sends away only the unhappy proud person. You must "hold him" well and strongly, with a 
				poor spirit, with a poor heart, with a life entirely poor"
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Raphael Kalinowski</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Satisfaction consists in the cutting off of the causes of the sin. Thus, fasting is the proper antidote to lust; prayer to pride, to envy, anger and sloth; 
				alms to covetousness."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Richard of Chichester</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
				 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"In prosperity, give thanks to God with humility and fear lest by pride you abuse God's benefits and so offend him."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Louis IX</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"We put pride into everything like salt. We like to see that our good works are known. If our virtues are seen, we are pleased; if our faults are perceived, we 
				are sad. I remark that in a great many people; if one says anything to them, it disturbs them, it annoys them. The saints were not like that -- they were vexed 
				if their virtues were known, and pleased that their imperfections should be seen."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Jean Marie Baptiste Vianney</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Virtues are formed by prayer. Prayer preserves temperance. Prayer suppresses anger. Prayer prevents emotions of pride and envy. Prayer draws into the soul the 
				Holy Spirit, and raises man to Heaven."
				<br/>
