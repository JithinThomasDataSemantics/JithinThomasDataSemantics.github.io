				"For there are three ways of performing an act of mercy: the merciful word, by forgiving and by comforting; 
				secondly, if you can offer no word, then pray - that too is mercy; and thirdly, deeds of mercy. 
				And when the Last Day comes, we shall be judged from this, and on this basis we shall receive the eternal verdict."

				"The saints are like the stars. In his providence Christ conceals them in a hidden place that 
				they may not shine before others when they might wish to do so. Yet they are always ready

				their heart the invitation of Christ."
