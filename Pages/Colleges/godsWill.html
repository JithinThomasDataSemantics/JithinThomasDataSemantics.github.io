				"Lord what wilt Thou have me do? Behold the true sign of a totally perfect soul: when one has reached the point of giving up his will so 
				completely that he no longer seeks , expects or desires to do ought but that which God wills."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Bernard</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"You well know that I preferred his company to all the delights of the world. But since it has pleased You to take him from me, I accept Your 
				will completely."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Elizabeth (On the death of her husband)</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"A soul who is really resigned to God's will does not become attached to any created thing because he sees clearly that all things are 
				nothing except God."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Blessed Henry Susone</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"All that the beginner in prayer has to do -- and you must not forget this, for it is very important -- is to labour and be resolute and 
				prepare himself with all possible diligence to bring his will into conformity with the will of God. As I shall say later, you may be quite 
				sure that this comprises the very greatest perfection which can be attained on the spiritual road."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Teresa of Jesus</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"More determination is required to subdue the interior man than to mortify the body; and to break one's will than to break one's bones."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Ignatius of Loyola</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"I desire to suffer always and not to die. I should add: this is not my will, it is my inclination. It is sweet to think of Jesus; but it is 
				sweeter to do His will."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Bl Mary of Jesus Crucified "The Little Arab"</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"The goal of all our undertakings should be not so much a task perfectly completed as the accomplishment of the will of God."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St Therese of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Perfection is founded entirely on the love of God: 'Charity is the bond of perfection;' and perfect love of God means the complete union of 
				our will with God's."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Alphonsus de Ligouri</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"I will attempt day by day to break my will into pieces. I want to do God's Holy Will, not my own!"
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Gabriel of the Sorrowful Mother</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"God wills only our good; God loves us more than anybody else can or does love us. His will is that no one should lose his soul, that 
				everyone should save and sanctify his soul: 'Not willing that any should perish, but that all should return to penance.' 'This is the 
				will of God, your sanctification.' God has made the attainment of our happiness, his glory. Even chastisements come to us, not to crush 
				us, but to make us mend our ways and save our souls."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Alphonsus de Ligouri</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"If, devout soul, it is your will to please God and live a life of serenity in this world, unite yourself always and in all things to the 
				divine will. Reflect that all the sins of your past wicked life happened because you wandered from the path of God’s will."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Alphonsus de Ligouri</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Here the will of God is done, as God wills, and as long as God wills."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Gerard Majella</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>

			<p id="blueDiv">
				"The first end I propose in our daily work is to do the will of God; secondly, to do it in the manner he wills it; and thirdly to do it 
				because it is his will."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"During our sojourn in this world, we should learn from the saints now in heaven, how to love God. The pure and perfect love of God they 
				enjoy there, consists in uniting themselves perfectly to his will. It would be the greatest delight of the seraphs to pile up sand on the 
				seashore or to pull weeds in a garden for all eternity, if they found out such was God’s will. Our Lord himself teaches us to ask to do the 
				will of God on earth as the saints do it in heaven: 'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven'."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Alphonsus de Ligouri</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"God made known to me, what true love consists in and gave light to me about how, in practice, to give proof of it to Him. True love of God 
				consists in carrying out God's will. To show God our love in what we do, all our actions, even the least, must spring from our love of God."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Diary of Saint Faustina</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"There are times when He Himself allows terrible sufferings, and then again there are times when He does not let me suffer and removes 
				everything that might afflict my soul. These are His ways , unfathomable and incomprehensible to us. It is for us to submit ourselves 
				completely to His holy will. There are mysteries that the human mind will never fathom here on earth; eternity will reveal them."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Faustina</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="blueDiv">
				"When shall it be that we shall taste the sweetness of the Divine Will in all that happens to us, considering in everything only His good 
				pleasure, by whom it is certain that adversity is sent with as much love as prosperity, and as much for our good? When shall we cast 
				ourselves undeservedly into the arms of our most loving Father in Heaven, leaving to Him the care of ourselves and of our affairs, and 
				reserving only the desire of pleasing Him, and of serving Him well in all that we can?"
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Jane Frances de Chantal</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"My child, make the resolution never to rely on people. Entrust yourself completely to My will saying," Not as I want, but according to Your 
				will, O God, let it be done unto me." These words, spoken from the depths of one's heart, can raise a soul to the summit of sanctity in a 
				short time. In such a soul I delight. Such a soul gives Me glory. Such a soul fills heaven with the fragrance of her virtue. But understand 
				that the strength by which you bear sufferings comes from frequent Communions. So approach this fountain of mercy often, to draw with the 
				vessel of trust whatever you need."(Jesus to Suffering Souls)

				"We can only learn to know ourselves and do what we can - namely, surrender our will and fulfill God's will in us."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Teresa of Avila</em>
				</strong></p>	
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Every creature, whether it will or not, is subject to the one God and Lord; but a warning is given to us, to serve the Lord with our whole 
				will, because the just man serves Him willingly, but the unjust serves Him as a slave."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Augustine</em>

				"A man makes the most progress and merits the most grace precisely in those matters wherein he gains the greatest victories over self and 
				most mortifies his will."
