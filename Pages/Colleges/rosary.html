				"If you say the Rosary faithfully until death, I do assure you that, in spite of the gravity of your sins 
			"you shall receive a never-fading crown of glory." Even if you are on the brink of damnation, even if you have one foot in hell, 
			even if you have sold your soul to the devil as sorcerers do who practice black magic, and even if you are
			 a heretic as obstinate as a devil, sooner or later you will be converted and will amend your life and save your soul, 
			 if - and mark well what I say - if you say the Rosary devoutly every day until death for the purpose of knowing the truth and 
			 obtaining contrition and pardon for your sins."

				"You always leave the Rosary for later, and you end up not saying it at all because you are sleepy. 
				If there is no other time, say it in the street without letting anybody notice it. It will, moreover, help you to have presence of God."

				"There is another related in the Chronicles of St. Dominic. Near Carcassonne, where St. Dominic was preaching the Rosary, 
				there was an unfortunate heretic who was possessed by a multitude of devils. 
				These evil spirits to their confusion were compelled at the command of our Lady to confess many great 
				and consoling truths concerning devotion to her. They did this so clearly and forcibly that, 
				however weak our devotion to our Lady may be, we cannot read this authentic story containing such 
				an unwilling tribute paid by the devils to devotion to our Lady without shedding tears of joy."

				"They will have the two-edged sword of the word of God in their mouths and the blood-stained standard 
				of the Cross on their shoulders. They will carry the crucifix in their right hand and the rosary in their left, 
				and the holy names of Jesus and Mary on their heart. The simplicity and self-sacrifice of Jesus will be reflected 
				in their whole behaviour."

				"Among the various supplications with which we successfully appeal to the Virgin Mother of God, 
				the Holy Rosary without doubt occupies a special and distinct place. 
				This prayer, which some call the Psalter of the Virgin or Breviary of the Gospel and of Christian life, 
				was described and recommended by Our Predecessor of happy memory, Leo XIII"

				"The faults of children are not always imputed to the parents, especially when they have instructed them and given good example. 
				Our Lord, in His wonderous Providence, allows children to break the hearts of devout fathers and mothers. 
				Thus the decisions your children have made don't make you a failure as a parent in God's eyes. You are entitled to feel sorrow,
				 but not necessarily guilt. Do not cease praying for your children; God's grace can touch a hardened heart. 
				 Commend your children to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. When parents pray the Rosary,at the end of each decade they 
				 should hold the Rosary aloft and say to her,"With these beads bind my children to your Immaculate Heart", 
				 she will attend to their souls."
