				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Philip Neri</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The more a person loves God, the more reason he has to hope in Him.

				those who love Him, they place all their confidence and find all their repose in Him alone."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Alphonsus Liguori</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">

					<em>--St. Teresa Margaret</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">

				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Teresa</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
