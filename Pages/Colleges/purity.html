				"We must be pure. I do not speak merely of the purity of the senses. We must observe great purity in our will, in our intentions, in all our actions."

				"Chastity is a difficult, long term matter; one must wait patiently for it to bear fruit, for the happiness of loving kindness which it must bring. But at the

					<em>--Pope John Paul II</em>

				"In the realm of evil thoughts none induces to sin as much as do thoughts that concern the pleasure of the flesh."

				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Thomas Aquinas</em>

			 </p>
						 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"In temptations against chastity, the spiritual masters advise us, not so much to contend with the bad thought, as to turn the mind to some spiritual, or, at 
				least, indifferent object. It is useful to combat other bad thoughts face to face, but not thoughts of impurity."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Alphonsus Liguori</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"To be pure, to remain pure, can only come at a price, the price of knowing God and loving him enough to do his will. He will always give us the strength we 
				need to keep purity as something as beautiful for him."

				"Never talk of impure things or events, not even to deplore them. Look, it's a subject that sticks more than tar. Change the conversation, or if that's not

				"We take vows of chastity to love Christ with undivided love;"

					 <em>--Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta</em>

			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"A clean heart is a free heart. A free heart can love Christ with an undivided love in chastity, convinced that nothing and nobody will separate it from his 
				love. Purity, chastity, and virginity created a special beauty in Mary that attracted God’s attention. He showed his great love for the world by giving Jesus 
				to her."

				<strong>
					<em>--Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta</em>

			<p id="skyDiv">
				"A pure soul is like a fine pearl. As long as it is hidden in the shell, at the bottom of the sea, no one thinks of admiring it. But if you bring it into the 
				sunshine, this pearl will shine and attract all eyes. Thus the pure soul, which is hidden from the eyes of the world, will one day shine before the Angels in 
				the sunshine of eternity."

				"Like a beautiful white dove rising from the midst of the waters, and coming to shake her wings over the earth, the Holy Spirit issues from the infinite ocean 
				of the Divine perfections, and hovers over pure souls, to pour into them the balm of love. The Holy Spirit reposes in a pure soul as in a bed of roses. There 
				comes forth from a soul in which the Holy Spirit resides a sweet odor, like that of the vine when it is in flower."

				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint John Marie Vianney</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Chastity is the lily of virtues, and makes men almost equal to Angels. Everything is beautiful in accordance with its purity. Now the purity of man is 
				chastity, which is called honesty, and the observance of it, honor and also integrity; and its contrary is called corruption; in short, it has this peculiar 
				excellence above the other virtues, that it preserves both soul and body fair and unspotted."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Francis of Sales, Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"What is more comely than chastity, which makes one generated from impure seed pure; an enemy, a friend; and a man, an Angel? There is a difference, indeed, 
				between a chaste man and an Angel, but in happiness, not in virtue; the Angel's chastity is more happy; but man's is more proved."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, Father and Doctor of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Chastity, or cleanness of heart, holds a glorious and distinguished place among the virtues, because she, alone, enables man to see God; hence Truth itself 
				said, ‘Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.’"
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Augustine, Father and Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"There is no remedy so powerful against the heat of concupiscence as the remembrance of our Savior’s Passion. In all my difficulties I never found anything so 
				efficacious as the wounds of Christ: In them I sleep secure; from them I derive new life."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Augustine, Father and Doctor of the Church</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"If you desire to be chaste, be retired, be modest, be mortified."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Leonard of Port Maurice</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Humility is the safeguard of chastity. In the matter of purity, there is no greater danger than not fearing the danger. For my part, when I find a man secure 
				of himself and without fear, I give him up for lost I am less alarmed for one who is tempted and who resists by avoiding the occasions, than for one who is not 
				tempted and is not careful to avoid occasions. When a person puts himself in an occasion, saying, I shall not fall, it is an almost infallible sign that he 
				will fall, and with great injury to his soul."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Philip Neri</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"I tremble when I think of so many great men, who after their virtues had placed them among the stars, and almost fixed their habitation in Heaven, have 
				miserably fallen into most grievous sins and died impenitent. We have seen, Lord, the great lights of Thy Church fall from Heaven, being pulled from thence by 
				the infernal dragon; and, on the contrary, some that lay, as it were groveling on the ground, have been wonderfully elevated all at once by Thy almighty hand."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Augustine, Father and Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"Your good resolutions must not make you proud, but humble and diffident; you carry a large sum of gold about you, take care not to meet any highwaymen. In 
				this life there is nothing certain: we are in a continual warfare, and, therefore, ought to be on our guard day and night. We sail in a tempestuous sea that 
				threatens us on every side, and in a poor leaky vessel: the devil, who aims at nothing less than our destruction, never ceases to increase the storm, to 
				overwhelm us thereby, if he can; hence it was that the Apostle gave this precaution, even to the virtuous: ‘Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest 
				he fall’ (1 Cor. x.12)"
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Jerome, Father and Doctor of the Church, Epistle to Saint Eustochium.</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Some complain that mankind will fail if so many are consecrated virgins. I desire to know who ever wanted a wife and could not find one? The killing of an 
				adulterer, the pursuing or waging war against a ravisher, are the consequences of marriage. The number of people is greatest where virginity is most esteemed. 
				Enquire how many virgins are consecrated every year at Alexandria, all over the East and in Africa, where there are more virgins than men in the country."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Saint Ambrose, Father and Doctor of the Church</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"The state of grace is nothing other than purity, and it gives heaven to those who clothe themselves in it. Holiness, therefore, is simply the state of grace 
				purified, illuminated, beautified by the most perfect purity, exempt not only from mortal sin but also from the smallest faults; purity will make saints of 
				you! Everything lies in this!"
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Peter Eymard</em>

				"God bestows more consideration on the purity of the intention with which our actions are performed than on the actions themselves."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Augustine</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"You carry your snare everywhere and spread your nets in all places. You allege that you never invited others to sin. You did not indeed, by your words, but 
				you have done so by your dress and your deportment. ... When you have made another sin in his heart, how can you be innocent? Tell me, whom does this world 
				condemn? Whom do judges punish? Those who drink poison or those who prepare it and administer the fatal potion? You have prepared the abominable cup, you have 
				given the death dealing drink, and you are more criminal than are those who poison the body; you murder not the body but the soul. And it is not to enemies you 
				do this, nor are you urged on by any imaginary necessity , nor provoked by injury , but out of foolish vanity and pride."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint John Chrysostom</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Far be it from Christians that to do such deeds [as our done by pagan sinners] should enter their mind; for temperance dwells with them, self-restraint is 
				practiced, monogamy is observed, chastity is guarded, injustice is exterminated, sin is rooted out, righteousness is exercised, law is ministered, reverence is 
				preserved, God is acknowledged: truth controls, grace guards, peace protects, the holy word guides, wisdom teaches, life directs, God reigns."
