				"We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- 
				grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls."
				<br/>

					<em>--Blessed Mother Teresa</em>

				"Whenever anything disagreeable or displeasing happens to you, remember Christ crucified and be silent."

				"The tongue is a small member, but it does big things. A religious who does not keep silence will never attain holiness; that is, she will 
				never become a saint. Let her not delude herself - unless it is the Spirit of God who is speaking through her, for then she must not keep 
				silent. But, in order to hear the voice of God, one has to have silence in one's soul and to keep silence; not a gloomy silence but an 
				interior silence; that is to say, recollection in God."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Faustina</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"What we need most in order to make progress is to be silent before this great God with our appetite and with our tongue, for the language he 
				best hears is silent love."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St John of the Cross, OCD</em>

				"No man is safe in speaking unless he loves to be silent. No man rules safely unless he is willing to be ruled."

				"In silence and quiet the devout soul advances in virtue and learns the hidden truths of Scripture."

				"Wisdom enters through love, silence, and mortification. It is great wisdom to know how to be silent and to look at neither the remarks, nor 
				the deeds, nor the lives of others."

				"A judicious silence is always better than truth spoken without charity."

				<strong>
					<em>--St. Francis De Sales</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"It is best to learn to silence the faculties and to cause them to be still, so that God may speak."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St John of the Cross</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"A talkative soul lacks both the essential virtues and intimacy with God. A deeper interior life, one of gentle peace and of that silence 
				where the Lord dwells, is quite out of the question. A soul that has never tasted
				the sweetness of inner silence is a restless spirit which disturbs the silence of others."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Faustina, Divine Mercy in My Soul</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="skyDiv">
				"To be silent when we are impelled to utter words injurious to God or to our neighbour, is an act of virtue; but, to be silent in confessing 
				our sins, is the ruin of the soul."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Alphonsus De Liguori</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"It is better to remain silent than to speak the truth ill-humoredly, and spoil an excellent dish by covering it with bad sauce."
