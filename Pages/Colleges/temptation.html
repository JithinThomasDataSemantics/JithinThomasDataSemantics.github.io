				"Trials are nothing else but the forge that purifies the soul of all its imperfections."

				"When tempted, invoke your Angel. he is more eager to help you than you are to be helped! Ignore the devil and do not be afraid of him: He 
				trembles and flees at the sight of your Guardian Angel."

				"His Majesty [the Lord]...rewards great services with trials, and there can be no better reward, for out of trials springs love for God."

					<em>--St. Teresa of Avila</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"The more we see that any action springs not from the motive of obedience, the more evident is it that it is a temptation of the enemy; for 
				when God sends an inspiration, the very first effect of it is to infuse a spirit of docility."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Teresa of Avila</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Do not grieve over the temptations you suffer. When the Lord intends to bestow a particular virtue on us, He often permits us first to be 
				tempted by the opposite vice. Therefore, look upon every temptation as an invitation to grow in a particular virtue and a promise by God that 
				you will be successful, if only you stand fast."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Philip Neri</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Our Lord wills that you cling to Him alone! If your faith were greater how much more peaceful you would be even when great trials surround 
				and oppress you."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Paula Frassinetti</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Virtue is nothing without the trial of temptation, for there is no conflict without an enemy, no victory without strife."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Pope St. Leo the Great</em>
				</strong></p>	
		
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"If your enemies see that you grow courageous, and that you will neither be seduced by flatteries nor disheartened by the pains and trials of 
				your journey, but rather are contented with them, they will grow afraid of you."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Blessed Henry Suso</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"The beginning of all temptation lies in a wavering mind and little trust in God, for as a rudderless ship is driven hither and yon by waves, 
				so a careless and irresolute man is tempted in many ways. Fire tempers iron and temptation steels the just. Often we do not know what we can 
				stand, but temptation shows us what we are.
				Above all, we must be especially alert against the beginnings of temptation, for the enemy is more easily conquered if he is refused 
				admittance to the mind and is met beyond the threshold when he knocks."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Francis De Sales</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"When we find ouselves in some grave danger we must not lose courage but firmly trust in God, for where there is the greatest danger, there is 
				also the greatest help from Him who wants to be called our 'Help' in times of peace and in times of tribulation."	
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Ambrose</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Dear brothers and sisters, I pray God may open your eyes and let you see what hidden treasures he bestows on us in the trials from which the 
				world thinks only to flee. Shame turns into honor when we seek God's glory. Present affliction become the source of heavenly glory. To those 
				who suffer wounds in fighting his battles God opens his arms in loving, tender friendship. That is why he (Christ) tells us that if we want 
				to join him, we shall travel the way he took. It is surely not right that the Son of God should go his way on the path of shame while the 
				sons of men walk the way of worldly honor: "The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant greater than his master." 
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--from a letter by Saint John of Avila</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Your first task is to be dissatisfied with yourself, fight sin, and transform yourself into something better. Your second task is to put up 
				with the trials and temptations of this world that will be brought on by the change in your life and to persevere to the very end in the 
				midst of these things."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--St. Augustine</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"There are in truth three states of the converted: the beginning, the middle, and the perfection. In the beginning they experience the charms 
				of sweetness; in the middle the contests of temptation; and in the end the fullness of perfection."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--Pope St. Gregory the Great</em>
				</strong></p>	
				
			<p id="yellowDiv">
				"Stop entertaining those vain fears. Remember it is not feeling which constitutes guilt but the consent to such feelings. Only the free will 
				is capable of good or evil. But when the will sighs under the trial of the tempter and does not will what is presented to it, there is not 
				only no fault but there is virtue."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Pio of Pietrelcina</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"We should not despair, therefore, when we are tempted, but pray to God the more fervently that He may see fit to help us, for according to 
				the word of Paul, He will make issue with temptation that we may be able to bear it. Let us humble our souls under the hand of God in every 
				trial and temptation for He will save and exalt the humble in spirit.
				In temptations and trials the progress of a man is measured; in them opportunity for merit and virtue is made more manifest.
				When a man is not troubled it is not hard for him to be fervent and devout, but if he bears up patiently in time of adversity, there is hope 
				for great progress.
				Some, guarded against great temptations, are frequently overcome by small ones in order that, humbled by their weakness in small trials, they 
				may not presume on their own strength in great ones."
				<br/>

				"There is no more evident sign that anyone is a saint and of the number of the elect, than to see him leading a good life and at the same time 
				a prey to desolation, suffering, and trials."
				 <br/>
				 <strong>
					 <em>--Saint Aloysius Gonzaga</em>
				 </strong>
			 </p>
			 
			<p id="greenDiv">
				"Once when I was being crushed by these dreadful sufferings, I went into the chapel and said from the bottom of my soul, "Do what You will 
				with me, O Jesus; I will adore You in everything. May Your will be done in me, O my Lord and my God, and I will praise Your infinite mercy." 
				Through this act of submission, these terrible torments left me. Suddenly I saw Jesus, who said to me, I am always in your heart. An 
				inconceivable joy entered my soul, and a great love of God set my heart aflame. I see that God never tries us beyond what we are able to 
				suffer. ...one act of trust at such moments gives greater glory to God than whole hours passed in prayer filled with consolations. Now I see 
				that if God wants to keep a soul in darkness, no book, no confessor can bring it light."
				<br/>
				<strong>
					<em>--St. Faustina, Divine Mercy in my Soul</em>

				"Do not bargain with any temptation; lock yourself immediately in My[Jesus] Heart and, at the first opportunity, reveal the temptation to the 
				confessor.....Do not fear struggle; courage itself often intimidates temptations, and they dare not attack us."
				 <br/>
